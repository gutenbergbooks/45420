<h2><span class="smcap">The Translator's</span> <i>Advertisement</i>.</h2>

<p class="indent">The following Lectures, being frequently referred to by the
Author of them in the Preface and Notes to his Translation of <i>Virgil</i>,
were thought proper to be communicated to the World in <i>English</i>,
that both Works might speak the same Language as well as Sentiment, and
address themselves to the same Sett of Readers. Whatever Reasons have
been given for translating <i>Virgil</i>, and writing an <i>English</i>
Comment on him, may be urged in behalf of these <i>English</i> Lectures,
which as they are an Illustration of Poetry in general, so are they of
<i>Virgil</i> in particular.</p>


<p class="indent">The Notes to this Edition were chiefly added as it went
through the Press: In which though I sometimes differ from my ingenious Author,
yet I hope not with greater Freedom than he has taken with others,
and will pardon in me. I am well aware how easy it is to let some
Mistakes slip in the Heat of Composition: And when these had once pass'd
the Press, the Author, I suppose, was not very sollicitous to re-examine
minutely the subsequent Editions; satisfied with the Approbation he had
received from that learned Body before whom his Lectures were first
delivered. An Honour which I shall never wish to see diminish'd
by any thing I can say, or any one else: And shall now therefore with
much greater Pleasure take this Opportunity of repeating the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>
following Testimony of them from Mr. <i>Felton</i>'s <i>Preface to his
Dissertation on Reading the Classics</i> p. xxi, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>What a polite Critic may do, if he pleases, and in how
different an Aspect Criticism appears, when formed by Men of Parts and Fire, we
may see in the three Volumes of Dr.</i> Trapp's Prӕlectiones
Poeticӕ.<i>A Work that cannot be enough commended, whether we consider
the Curiousness of his Observations, the Justness of his Remarks, the
Truth and Importance of his Rules, the Aptness and Beauty of his
Examples, Force and Elegance of his Style, and the Penetration of his
Wit and Judgment: A Piece in such Perfection of Beauty, that he gives
the Rules with the same Spirit we find in the Examples; and maketh those
Dissertations, which in heavy, formal Hands,
would have looked crabbed, dull, and dry, shine
in all the Graces, that Life, and Ease, and Vigour
can adorn them with. We see how entertaining
the severest Criticisms are in a Poet's Hand,
and what Life and Spirit he can give to the dryest
Part of his Subject, while he prescribes the
Rules and fixes the Laws of Poetic Diction, weigheth
the Importance of Words, and considers the
several Ways of Expression peculiar to the Poets.
And if Men of such Learning and such Parts
would undertake this Province, I cannot help
repeating it, we should see more and more into the
Propriety, Strength, and Compass, and all the
hidden Beauties of the</i> Greek <i>and</i> Latin <i>Tongues.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span>
</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><span class="smcap">The Author's Preface.</span></h2>

<p class="indent">I have no Occasion to detain the Reader
with a Preface in Praise of Poetry: What I
thought proper to say on that Head, he will
find comprised in the following <i>Introductory Oration</i>.
I shall only just in a few Words lay before
him the Purport of the following Sheets.</p>

<p class="indent">Being elected into the Professorship by that
venerable Body the Convocation at <i>Oxford</i>, I thought
it incumbent on me to discharge my Duty in it according
to the best of my Abilities. The better to
do so, I endeavour in the following Lectures to
keep such a Medium in examining the Sentiments of
the several Writers on Poetry that tho' I pay much
Deference to their Authority, yet I don't slavishly
adhere to their Decrees. For Books are to be consider'd
as Helps to Learning, not Fetters to it; and
it is just, in these sort of Studies especially, that
every Man, after he has weigh'd the Opinion of
others should be at Liberty to follow his own.</p>

<p class="indent">This Method I take to be the most entertaining
and the most useful both to the Writer and the
Reader. No one, I am persuaded, will suspect I
pursued it for the sake of Ease; since it is much
harder to <i>digest</i> than to <i>transcribe</i>. And,
indeed, what can be a more arduous Task, than to unfold
the Nature of Poetry in general, and its different
Species; to explain the various Elegances of Style,
and its no less various Defects; to explore the secret
Turns of the Mind; to weigh the minutest <i>Momenta</i>
of Wit; to separate in things of so great Delicacy,
Truth from Falshood; to shew by what
Springs they delight or ravish their Readers or Hearers?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span></p>


<p class="indent">I thought proper just to say so much of the
Difficulty of the present Work, not out of a Desire of
gaining Praise, but Pardon; that if I have fallen into
any Errors, I may meet with some Favour from
the Learned. For to their Judgment I submit myself,
and the Fortunes of this Book; always ready
to receive more full Instruction, and to retract,
not to defend the Mistakes of it.</p>

<p class="indent">But arduous and difficult as these Enquiries
are, yet not therefore unpleasant; For it is not to be
thought that all Discourses which deliver Rules and
Precepts are dry and unentertaining; some are no
less full of Delight than Advantage. Of which
sort is the Subject before us, elegant in its Nature,
and agreeable to the Taste of the most Polite; who
are never better pleased than when they scrutinise
into the Laws of just Writing and true Thought,
and have the choicest Examples of each laid before
them. The Mind is charmed with tracing out its
own Operations; and while on so refined a Subject
we read Authors of the same Sentiments with ourselves,
we observe with secret Complacence, similar
Ideas arise in our Minds; or if we dissent from
a good Writer, we are ready to join in his Praise
tho' not in his Opinion: For such an one, tho' he
misses the Truth, yet deviates with Ingenuity, and
is elegant even in his Mistakes.</p>

<p class="indent">The Difficulties then we are speaking of,
are such that they don't deter the Admirers of Polite
Literature, but invite them: Such as are not attended
with Uncouthness of Thought or Asperity of
Style; but are like the Labours of Lovers, who,
to gain the Good-will of the Fair, go through the
most arduous Tasks and solicite Dangers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">If the Reader will observe in the following
Sheets some Errors slipt, some Defects either in
Thought or Expression, he will at worst have no
Reason to complain that I have too importunately
loaded him. He will rather wonder perhaps, on
the other Hand, how I durst pretend to treat of
such Variety of Matter in so few Pages: An Accusation,
to which I know not how to give a satisfactory
Answer, and which I own I have often
been ready to draw up against myself. I can only
declare that this has been owing either to Chance,
or to the Nature of my Subject, or to my own Inabilities,
not to Indolence, for I have omitted nothing
which after the most mature Deliberation I
thought proper to be taken Notice of. In other
respects I own I studied <i>Brevity</i> as much as possible,
rejecting many things that offer'd, which I judged
unentertaining, superfluous, and such as would give
the Reader rather Pain than Pleasure; many likewise,
which tho' proper Observations in themselves,
yet had been abundantly taken Notice of by
others; whose Writings I had no Inclination to
make so free with, as to purloin.</p>

<p class="indent">And this, I hope, will not be imputed to
me as an Imperfection: For <i>Brevity as such</i> (to use
the Language of the Schoolmen) and considered in its
own Nature, is by no means a Fault; but rather an
Excellence, if we keep clear of those Faults that
often adhere to it. If we do Justice to our Subject
and are at the same time perspicuous, we cannot
be too concise; especially in those Works where
we propose to <i>delight</i> the Reader, as well
as <i>profit</i> him.</p>

<p class="indent">How far this has been effected in the following
Sheets, must be left entirely to his Judgment. I am
sure my Endeavour has been not to be wanting to
both these Ends, and I might with more <i>Ease</i> to
myself have wrote a <i>larger Book</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
To treat of Elegance in an inelegant Manner is a
mere Absurdity; and Conciseness is generally an
Attendant of Elegance. Nothing I am sure can
afford more Pleasure to the Understanding than an
accurate Enquiry into the Subjects here treated of:
Nothing greater Difficulty to a Writer, who is to
act the Critic and Philosopher, rather than the Historian.
Even Metaphysics do not more try the
Mind than Poetry, when we search into the latent
Sources of its Beauties and Allurements. But the
Pleasure in the one is much greater than in the other:
This has its <i>Thorns</i>; but such as grow on the <i>Rose</i>,
tender and yielding, that heighten at once its <i>Sweetness</i>
and its <i>Beauty</i>.</p>

<p class="indent space-below">One Thing I would desire the Reader to
observe; that under each Head of Poetry, I have either
wholly omitted every thing that is Historical, or
but lightly touch'd upon it: Not became I think
by any Means that Part of Learning contemptible;
but partly because I find it more suitable to my Nature
(such as it is) to search into Things than Facts;
and partly because others, whose Erudition I very
much reverence, and to whom I always refer my
Reader, have already in this Respect, deserv'd well
of the Learned. However, in one or two of my
Dissertations I could not come at the <i>Nature</i> of the
Subject I treated of without enquiring into the
<i>History</i> of it: as in those upon the <i>Origin of Poetry
in general</i>, upon <i>Epigram</i>, and <i>Satire</i>.
But even in them to enter into a long Detail of Circumstances
fetch'd from the Writings of the Ancients, wou'd
be doing Nothing but what had been done before;
which is the Thing I have throughout endeavour'd
to avoid. My Aim has been not to be tedious;
and for fear I should be so now, I shall add no
more; but leave my Book to stand or fall by the
Opinion of the Learned.</p>

<h2>LECTURE I.</h2>

<p class="indent">Altho', Gentlemen, I am sensible of the
Obligation you have laid upon me, by making
Choice of me to fill this Office, esteeming
it an Honour to receive Commands, much more
Favours from so venerable a Body; yet I must own
myself under some Concern, when I consider that I
enter into a Province unattempted by others, and
wherein I have no Footsteps to guide me. For so
it has happen'd, that tho' all other Sciences the
World can boast of, have had their Instructors and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Professors in this most flourishing University;
<span class="smcap">Poetry</span> alone, neglected, as it were,
and overlook'd, has hitherto wanted Schools for her Reception.
'Twas much, indeed, that in the very Seat of the
Muses that Art shou'd have found none, which the
Muses esteem above all others, and claim as their
peculiar Property: With You it has always been its
Choice to live, and with You it always has liv'd;
but has wanted, however, a fix'd Habitation, and (if
I may speak more poetically) has wander'd here
among other Sciences, as <i>Delos</i>, <i>Apollo</i>'s native
Place, did among the <i>Ægean</i> Islands, till that excellent
Gentleman, whose Munificence I now commemorate,
like another <i>Apollo</i>, fix'd its Situation, and
honour'd it with an Establishment.</p>

<p class="indent">But to omit these imaginary Flights, and to
represent Things without any Colouring, What Thanks
are due to him, who has render'd himself a perpetual
<i>Mæcenas</i>, not only to Poets, but to Poetry itself;
who has bestow'd Honours upon that Art,
which adds the greatest to whatever is meritorious;
who has prescribed it Laws, and secured to it a Patrimony?
But still without a Patrimony it had almost
been, if the reverend and worthy Trustees<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
of the Muses Legacy had not to the Patron's Benevolence
contributed no small Assistance of their own,
and deserved little less Praise by receding from their
Due, than the other, by his original Settlement.
One of them<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,
especially, who, as he is himself no small Part
of <i>our</i> University, and of <i>that</i> venerable
Assembly, and has an Intercourse with <i>both</i>,
makes use of it to promote Good-will and Friendship
mutually between them. How near had the Poetical
Revenues been lost, if they had not been in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Hands of Men therefore the most zealous for Learning
and the University, because they were adorned with
the <i>Insignia</i> of each? If these good Men reject our
Praises, at least let them permit us to return our
Thanks. To the Living, then, we gratefully pay the
Tribute of Gratitude; to the Deceased, whose Gift
they augmented, that of Glory.</p>

<p class="indent">He well knew that Poetry did not boast so
much of her learned Poverty (noted even to a Proverb) as
utterly to reject all Acquisitions. He knew, moreover,
that it was no less capable of Rules than other
Arts, and no less deserving of them; that it proceeded
upon certain Principles, which were founded
upon Truth and right Reason; that our Master <i>Aristotle</i>,
who has accurately treated of the other Sciences,
and whose Authority we follow in them all,
had bestowed likewise some of his Pains on this, and
has left upon no Subject greater Monuments, either
of Extent of Genius, or of Care and Application.</p>

<p class="indent">They therefore lie under a great Mistake,
that think Poetry suited only to the Theatre, and would
have it banished from the Schools, as of too unbounded
a Nature to submit to the Regulation of
Precept. Rage, indeed, is its Property; but a Rage
altogether divine; not deviating from Reason, but
rendering it more ornamental and sublime. It may
be said, likewise, to be a Fire; not like our consuming
ones, but like those of the celestial Orbs
above, that have not only the Qualities of Heat and
Brightness, but maintaining one uniform Course, are
carried round their Orbits at once with equal Swiftness
and Regularity.</p>

<p class="indent">We see, then, it is no Absurdity to have Rules
prescribed to this Art. And what could have been
thought of, of so delicate and refined a Nature, as
the Office of prescribing them? What more worthy
of an University to accept, or a Courtier to appoint?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
A Courtier, I say, for in the City he was an Ornament
to the Court; as in the University he was to
that House, which has always had the Credit of abounding,
and we still have the Comfort of seeing it
abound with Gentlemen of the most distinguish'd
Wit, Birth, and good Manners. I am sure no Gift
could have been more becoming a Friend of the
Muses to bestow, and he was not only an Admirer,
but an Intimate of them; not only a Lover of their
Art, but a skilful Practitioner in it; nor could any
one so properly make Poetry his Heir, as a Poet.</p>

<p class="indent">He knew, by Experience, that no Pleasure
was equal to the reading ancient Poets, except that of
imitating them. Happy they, that can partake of
both; but the former ought to be the Employment of
all, that desire to have any Taste for Letters, or Politeness.
Some there are, however, to whom these Studies
are disagreeable, and who endeavour to make them so
to others: This is not owing to any Fault in Poetry,
but in themselves. Formed as they are of coarse Materials,
they have naturally a Disposition either slow
and frozen, callous and unpolite, or harsh and morose;
so, forsooth, whilst they would appear grave,
as they are, they maliciously hate, or superciliously
contemn these Exercises, as the great Disturbers of
their Peace. They condemn what they know nothing
of; and despise the Pleasure they want a Capacity to enjoy.</p>

<p class="indent">But if at least they pay any Deference to
Antiquity (and with these Men nothing uses to be more
sacred, looking upon every Thing with the greater
Veneration, the more antient it is) they ought on
this Account to allow the Art we are speaking of
its due Honours. For not to urge that Poetry is coeval
with the World itself, and that the Creator may
be said in working up and finishing his beautiful Poem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
of the Universe, to have performed the Part of a
Poet, no less than of a Geometrician<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>;
it is well known, that those Books have had the greatest
Sanction from Time, that have been dictated by God, or
writ by Poets. Those, as it is fit, have the Precedence:
But these follow at no very great Distance.</p>

<p class="indent">Nay, why should we make this Difference
between the sacred Writers and Poets, since the sacred
Writers were most of them Poets; on both Accounts
deservedly called <i>Vates</i> (<i>a Word expressing either
Character</i>) and acted by no feigned Inspiration?
That the Devils then, heretofore, usurping the Title
of Gods, gave out their Oracles in Verse, was owing
wholly to their imitating, in this, as well as in other
Particulars, the true God, that so they might gain
Honour and Reverence from their Votaries. If in
the Poems of <i>Job</i>, and <i>David</i>, and the other sacred
Authors, we observe the inexpressible Sublimity of
their Words and Matter; their elegant, and more
than human Descriptions; the happy Boldness of their
Metaphors; their spiritual Ardour breathing Heaven,
and winging the Souls of their Readers up to it, triumphing,
as it were, by a royal Authority, over the
narrow Rules of mortal Writers, it is impossible but
we must in Transport own, that nothing is wanting
in them, that might be expected from the Strength of
Poetry heighten'd by the Energy of Inspiration.</p>

<p class="indent">If this, then, be the Case, who would not
wonder at the Ignorance or Baseness of those, who rashly
reproach an Art with Impiety, which has the Honour
of being not only pleasing to God, but taught and
dictated by him. 'Tis true, Poetry, as well as Religion,
has, by Length of Time, been corrupted with
Fables; but this is no more to be imputed to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
one than the other; and we can only from hence
complain, that by the Depravity of Mankind the
best of Things are most liable to Corruption.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor is it any more owing to the Art itself,
that it is sometimes polluted by obscene Writers: To
them alone the Infamy redounds: The Chastity of
Poetry is violated like a Virgin's, and tho' it seems
to be the Instrument of doing an Injury to Virtue,
yet Virtue is not more a Sufferer than she is. She
acts in her proper Sphere, when, with her native
Purity, she discovers the true Attractives of Virtue,
nor disguises Vice with false ones; when she inflames
the Mind of Man with the Love of Goodness,
recounts the Works of the Almighty, and sets
forth all his Praises. Undoubtedly, as the divine and
sister Sciences, Poetry and Music, owe their Origin
to Heaven; they love to be employed about heavenly
Things; thither they tend by their native Force,
and, like Fire, seek those blessed Abodes from
whence they first descended.</p>

<p class="indent">Since Poetry, then, is so venerable, both
for its Antiquity, and its Religion; they are no less to blame,
who look upon it as a trifling Amusement, an Exercise
for Boys only, or young Men. The Injustice
of this Calumny is plain from hence, that a good
Proficient in this kind of Writing must not only excel
in Wit, Elegance, and Brightness; but must be
endowed with the maturest Judgment, and furnished
with all sorts of Literature. He must, in Truth,
turn over the Annals of Time, and Monuments of
History; he must trace the Situation of Countries,
understand the different Manners of Nations; the
Actions and Passions of Mankind in general, must
explore the inmost Recesses of the Mind, and secret
Avenues to them; survey the whole System of the
Universe; in short, make himself Master of all Nature.
Who cannot but see and admire the Learning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of <i>Homer</i> and <i>Horace</i>; in <i>Virgil</i> especially,
his almost universal Extent of Knowledge in both sorts
of Philosophy, in History, Geography, and the
chief of all Science, Mathematicks? In <i>Lucretius</i>
we see how perfectly Natural Philosophy and Poetry
agree; and how properly these Schools of ours are
appropriated to both: Nor have the severest Philosophers
Reason to complain, that the Company of
the one reflects the least Dishonour on the other.</p>

<p class="indent">This I am sure they have not, if we duly
consider the Nature of this admirable Art; from whence it
will appear to contain whatever is great or beautiful
in Prose, and besides to be distinguished by its
own proper Ornaments; which it abundantly displays,
whilst it pleases our Ears, and ravishes our
Souls with its Harmony; whilst it strongly imprints
in our Minds the Images of the Things it represents;
by a becoming Fiction sets off Truth to Advantage,
and renders it more amiable; and by a decent Liberty
keeps those Laws it seems to violate.</p>

<p class="indent">Another Reason of its Contempt, at least
of the Abatement of its Esteem, is, that there are such
Numbers of Writers, who give Offence to Men of
Learning, by affecting the Title of <i>Poets</i>. This is
a Fact we are very sensible of, and lament: I know
not how it is, there's no sort of Learning to which
more apply themselves, or fewer attain. Innumerable
Pretenders there are, who, in spite of Genius
and Nature, are daily troubling the World with their
wretched Performances; who write Verse often,
that scarce attempt to write any Thing else, and venture
upon the most difficult of all Studies, that are
unfit for any. This profane Mob of Poetasters are
deservedly to be condemned, that arrogate to themselves
the Credit of a Title, that no ways belongs to
them; and which is due only to those who <i>are of
elevated Genius, and Souls divine</i>. But so far is this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
from fixing any true Mark of Infamy on our Art,
that it ought to redound to its Credit. For in this
its native Excellence appears, that it is a Mistress, to
whom all by natural Impulse, as it were, pay their
Addresses, tho' there are so few, upon whom she bestows
her Favours. Thus Wit, Wisdom, and Religion,
have each those amiable Colours, in which all
Mankind endeavour to appear.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor need we wonder it meets with such Esteem,
since it excels all other Sciences, by mixing so agreeably
<i>Pleasure</i> with <i>Advantage</i>. For it is found experimentally
true, that by reading the ancient Poets,
but especially by imitating them, the Mind is polish'd,
enlivened, and enlarged; is enriched with a
Stock of various Erudition, as well sacred as profane;
with such Plenty of lofty Ideas, and lively Expressions,
as is no small Addition to the Eloquence of even
Prose itself. This no one will deny, that pays any
Deference to <i>Cicero</i>'s Opinion or Authority; who
ingenuously tells us he owes no small Assistance to
the Poets, runs out largely in their Praises, and
seems to give them the first Place among the Learned.
"We are told, says he<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>,
by Men of the greatestLearning, that the Science of all
other Things depends upon Precepts and Art; but a Poet
on Nature alone; that he is formed by the Force of
Genius, and inspired, as it were, with somewhat
of Divinity." This Topick he defends, and expatiates
upon, with such Warmth, that Oratory seems
never to have shone out brighter, or to have been
more pleased with its own Force, than when it was
employed in the Praise of Poetry.</p>

<p class="indent">But farther, it ought by all Means to be
encouraged, because it raises the Mind to Virtue and Honour,
by delivering down the Examples of great
Men to Immortality. It not only celebrates Heroes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
but makes them; and by lively Copies produces
new Originals. What, in short, is it else, but
the utmost Effort of the Mind of Man, that tries all
its Nerves, while it infuses into it a Tincture of
universal Learning temper'd with the greatest Sweetness.
For its Votaries it affects with no small Pleasure,
which its infinite Variety abundantly supplies.
Oratory, like a River with all its Pomp of Water,
confines its Waves within its own Banks; but Poetry,
like the Ocean, diffuses itself, by a Variety of
Channels, into Rivers, Fountains, and the remotest
Springs. What can be more delightful, than to take
a Survey of Things, Places, and Persons; what
more elegant, than to see them represented in beautiful
Pictures? Who is not charm'd with the humorous
Turns of Epigram, the Softness of Elegy, the
bantering Wit of one sort of Satire, the Anger of
the other, the Keenness and Poignancy of both?
And yet still more the Ode affects us with its daring
Colours, its lofty Conceptions, its Choice of Expression,
its agreeable Variety of Numbers, and
(what is the distinguishing Character of the Lyrics)
that Luxuriancy of Thought, conducted with the severest
Judgment, by which it now and then expatiates
into new Matter, connects Things it seem'd to separate,
and falls by Chance, as it were, into its first
Subject. Who is there that does not with Pleasure
survey an Epitome of the World in the Dramatic
Poets? The Life, Humours, and Customs of Mankind
represented in Comedy; in Tragedy the tumultuous
Passions of the Great, the Turns of Fortune
and wonderful Catastrophes, the Punishment
of Villainy and Rewards of Virtue, and sometimes
the Misfortunes of good Men? Who, I say, is not
affected with Pleasure, whether he laughs or weeps
with them? For such is the Force of Poetry, that
it makes us pleased with our Tears, and from Sorrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
extorts Satisfaction. But far beyond all this, is the
Epic Poem, that farthest Extent of the human Soul,
the utmost Bounds of Study, and the Pillars, beyond
which the Labours of the Mind can never pass. So
abundant is it, that, besides its own peculiar Excellence,
than which nothing can be greater, it comprehends
within its Sphere all other Kinds of Poetry
whatever; and is in this Art what the Organ is in
Music, which with various Pipes, inflated with the
same Breath, charms us not only with its own Harmony,
but represents that of every other Instrument.</p>

<p class="indent">These are not Beauties only in Theory;
we have Authors that have shone in each of these Branches
of Poetry: Thus <i>Martial</i> pleases with his tart Facetiousness,
<i>Catullus</i> with his sound Wit, tho' his Verse
is sometimes a little harsh; <i>Ovid</i>, <i>Tibullus</i>,
and <i>Propertius</i>, with their Ease and Fluency in both. The
Man that does not admire the Boldness of <i>Juvenal</i>'s
Spirit, the Richness of his poetic Vein, and his fearless
Rage in Satire; may he never love, may he never
know the genteel and courtly Turns, the pleasant
Sneers, the severe, and yet inviting Precepts of Virtue,
the Remarks on common Life made with the
greatest Penetration, Judgment, and Wisdom, with
which the Satires of <i>Horace</i>, and especially his
Epistles, are replete. In this kind of Writing, as we
prefer him before all others; so in Lyric Poetry he
stands not only first, but alone. With Regard to
Comedy, if there were nothing remaining but what
<i>Terence</i> has left us, <i>viz.</i> that Chasteness of Style,
that never-failing Fund of Wit and Judgment, that
Humour clear of vulgar Jests, those beautiful Images
of Mankind and Nature, that exquisite Artifice in
working up Plots, and unfolding them; we should
ever have Reason to praise the Art and the Poet. If
Tragedy has receiv'd but small Ornaments from the
<i>Latin</i> Writers, as far as they have come to our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Hands; by the <i>Greeks</i> that Loss has been abundantly
compensated. Witness the Thunder and Vigour of
<i>Sophocles</i>, the Grandeur and sententious Gravity of
<i>Euripides</i>, the Art of both, with which they command
the Affections of their Readers, and call forth
Pity or Terror at Pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent">The Nature and Limits of this Discourse
will not allow me even to touch upon the Characters of all
the other <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> Writers that have
excell'd in the several Species of Poetry. One, however,
it would be unpardonable to omit, who as he is the
greatest of all (not <i>Homer</i> himself excepted) may
not improperly bring up the Rear of this shining
Host, the immortal <i>Virgil</i>, I mean, beyond all Praises,
in all Respects compleat. Who is not in Love
with the plain and unaffected Beauty of his Eclogues,
the finish'd and chaste Elegance of his <i>Georgics</i>, and
in them the entertaining Descriptions with which
they abound, with the Variety of their Expressions,
the Usefulness of their Precepts in Husbandry, and
their noble Excursions, upon every proper Occasion,
into Subjects of a sublimer Nature? But the divine
<i>Æneid</i> who can turn over without Transport, without
being lost, as it were, in a happy Mixture of Joy
and Wonder? Who can help being astonish'd at that
Fire of Imagination temper'd with so cool a Judgment,
such Strength united with so much Beauty?
To nothing this Work can with Justice be compar'd,
unless to that, whose Duration will have the
same Period, the great Machine of the Universe.
For where shall we find, in any human Composition,
so exact a Harmony between the several Parts,
and so much Beauty in each of them; such an infinite
Fecundity of Matter, without the least Exuberance
of Style, or Crowding of Incidents? It
would be an endless Attempt to recount the different
Images of Heroes, and other Personages that appear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
up and down in it, the Variety of Manners, the Conflict
of Passions, almost every Object of the Imagination
beautifully described, all Nature unfolded,
the great Events, the unexpected Revolutions, the
Incentives to Virtue; in the several Speeches the
most finish'd Eloquence; in the Thoughts and Expressions
the sublimest Majesty; in short, the most
consummate Art, by which all these Things are
brought into one uniform Piece?</p>

<p class="indent space-below">After the mention of <i>Virgil</i> and those
other great Names, Silence only should ensue; but that our
Oration naturally addresses itself to him, to whose
Indulgence this Liberty of speaking in the Praise of
<i>Virgil</i>, and those other great Names, is owing; our
most worthy Vice-chancellor<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>,
I mean, who has brought to Light this Poetic Legacy, which
had been buried, as it were, for many Years in Oblivion,
and has at length placed it upon a Foundation
that will make it perpetual. Such Attainments, Sir,
have you made in your Study of the publick Welfare!
'tis thus you make us sensible that none are so faithful
and diligent Dispensers of others Bounty, as
the Bountiful! I shall not enter into a Detail of the
other Virtues, that make up your Character: My
Business was to mention that only which relates to our
present Function: Permit us, however, to wish you
Length of Days in this World, that such Thanks
may in Time be due to you, as may exceed the Power
of Poetry itself to pay.

<h2>LECTURE II, and III.<br />
<small><i>Of the Nature and Origin of Poetry in general.</i></small></h2>
<hr class="r65" />

<p class="indent">Before we enter upon the different Branches
of the Art we propose to treat of, it may not be
improper to clear our Way, by giving, as the Schoolmen
speak, a general Idea of it, and laying before
you a comprehensive View of whatever is common
to all its Parts. None, that I know of, has
given a just Definition of it; not <i>Aristotle</i> himself,
tho' a perfect Master in <i>Definitions</i>: And yet there's
nothing in the Subject repugnant to one. To be
short, then, Poetry seems in general, <i>An Art of imitating
or illustrating in metrical Numbers every Being
in Nature, and every Object of the Imagination, for
the Delight and Improvement of Mankind</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Vossius</i>'s Definition<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
(I speak it with humble Deference
to so great a Man) to me is by no means satisfactory,
who makes Poetry consist in being <i>An
Art of representing Actions in Metre</i>. This Definition
falls too short, and is not comprehensive enough
of the Nature of the Thing defined. For I
would ask, is it not the Business of Poetry to represent
every Thing that is capable of being represented?
And are Actions the only Things capable
of being represented? This, indeed, is expresly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
asserted by <i>Dacier</i>, the <i>French</i> Interpreter of
<i>Aristotle</i>: But to any one that considers the Passage, it
will abundantly appear, that this Opinion cannot be
drawn from <i>Aristotle</i> by a just Interpretation of him.
That great Philosopher, and Prince of Critics, says,
that <i>Imitators imitate Actions</i>. Now, can any one,
without violating all the Rules of Reasoning this
Philosopher has taught, conclude from hence that
Actions <i>alone</i> are capable of being imitated? He indeed
says, or rather the <i>French</i> Version is made to
say, that <span class="smcap">All</span> <i>that imitate, imitate Actions</i>;
but in his own Original he says no such Thing; the Word
<span class="smcap">All</span> is added by the Interpreter:
His Words are<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>,
μιμουνἱαι ὁι μιμουμενοι πραἱἱονἱαϛ, i. e. <i>Imitators
imitate Actions</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">But if the Version were true, the Conclusion
drawn from it would, however, be false. For <i>All</i>
Imitators may imitate Actions, and yet possibly not
<i>Actions only</i>. But there's no need of many Words
to prove <i>Aristotle</i>'s Authority unjustly alledged for
this Proposition; since he tells us himself, a little before
the Passage above cited<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>,
μιμουνἱαι και ηθη και παθη και πραξειϛ,
i. e. <i>they imitate Manners, Passions, and
Actions</i>. He thought therefore that not only Actions,
but Manners and Affections, were capable of being
imitated. It is certain, if by Imitation is meant that
which impresses upon the Mind a true and genuine
Representation of any Thing, it will be no less repugnant
to common Sense than to <i>Aristotle</i>'s, to affirm
that nothing but Actions can be imitated. For,
besides them, we see Passions, Things, Places, and
Men are imitated, not only by Poets, but by Painters
too. This <i>Horace</i>, the best Interpreter of <i>Aristotle</i>,
sufficiently intimates, when he uses the Word
<i>imitari</i> in the same Sense with <i>describere</i>,
<i>pingere</i>, or <i>sculpere</i>:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Molles imitabitur ære capillos</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In Brass shall imitate the waving Hair.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Besides, <i>Vossius</i>'s Definition is short in
another Respect; as it makes the Object of Imitation too narrow,
so it makes the Essence of Poetry consist
<i>solely in Imitation</i>; whereas there are some Kinds of
it that have little to do with Imitation, but much in
Illustration; as we shall shew in the Sequel.</p>

<p class="indent">That Poetry is an <i>Art</i>, is sufficiently plain,
and we have no Occasion to use many Words to prove it.
It observes certain Laws and Rules, is brought to
the Test of right Reason, and, lastly, it aims at some
particular End. I cannot but wonder, therefore,
why those that fix'd the Number of the Liberal
Arts, as they are commonly reckon'd up, should have
allowed no Place for Poetry and Oratory among
them. They were thought, perhaps, reducible partly
to Rhetorick, and partly to Grammar. But this,
I think, they are not, with any Propriety. For, not
to observe that Poetry and Oratory are in their Merit
too good, and in their Extent too great to be included
in other Sciences, the Business of Rhetorick
is wholly to polish the Style of both of them; and,
by the Way, as it is now-a-days managed, tends more,
perhaps, to the Detriment and Corruption, than the
Credit and Honour of either; but is fully and professedly
concerned in neither. As to Grammar, they
can no more be reduced to that, than all other Sciences
whatever; for to all Sciences Words, whether
written or spoken, are subservient. Well, then,
<i>Vossius</i> and all agree that Poetry is an <i>Art</i>, tho' that
great Man has not sufficiently shewn the peculiar Business of it.</p>

<p class="indent">The Definition we have given above, seems to be
full, and every Way compleat, inasmuch as it comprehends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the whole Nature of Poetry, is applicable
only to Poetry, and all the Species of it; for all of
them are always concern'd, either in Imitation, or
Illustration, or both at once. Between these two
there is some Difference; for he that beautifully
imitates any Thing, always illustrates it; but not on
the contrary; the Rule does not hold <i>vice versa</i>.
Those Things that relate to Science, and Discipline,
such as the Ideas of the Mind, Virtues, Vices, Manners,
and the like, are <i>illustrated</i> by being explained;
but no one will say, that by being explained they are
<i>imitated</i>. But, as I said, it is an undoubted Maxim,
that all Kinds of Poetry are employed one or other
of these Ways, or both. In Descriptions of whatever
Kind, in moving the Passions, in Panegyric, in
Satire, in Heroics, in Ethics, the Poet either imitates
or illustrates something, or does both; unless,
perhaps, we ought to except the Writers of those
short Sentences, that are mere <i>moral Sayings</i>; such
as <i>Pythagoras</i>, <i>Phocyllides</i>, and the like; who may be
said, indeed, to write Verses, but not Poems: They
want the Force, the Elegance, the Style, and peculiar
Turn of Thought that discriminates Poets from
other Writers. 'Tis plain, then, the Business of Poets
is either Imitation or Illustration; and that, not only
of Actions, but, as we presumed to lay down in our
Definition, of every Being in Nature, or in the Imagination.
The Object, then, of Poetry, must be
enlarged, and those Bounds extended, that <i>Vossius</i>
prescribed to it: For is there any Thing in the real
or ideal World, not capable of being described or
illustrated? any Thing which the capacious Stretch of
Poetry will not comprehend?</p>

<p class="indent">And since it chiefly consists in Imitation, it may
not be amiss, perhaps, to make a short Comparison
between that and Painting. All Poetry will not admit
of this Comparison, but such only as consists in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Description; upon which whatever is in common
between them, depends. Painting, as well as Poetry
affects the Passions; That by Description alone, This
by other adventitious Arts. I would here, however,
particularly observe, that Poetry consists much more
in Description, than is generally imagined. For, besides
those longer and set Descriptions of Things,
Places, and Persons, there are numberless others, unobserved
by common Readers, contained in one
Verse, sometimes in one Word, to which the whole
Beauty of the Thought is owing; and which wonderfully
affect us, for no other Reason but because
they are Descriptions, that is, impress a lively Image
of somewhat upon the Mind. To this it is, that
metaphorical Expressions, when selected with Judgment,
owe their Beauty, and their Elegance; every
Metaphor being a short Description.</p>

<p class="indent">But to return to our Comparison between
Painting and Poetry. They both agree, in representing
to the Mind Images of Things, and ought both of
them to be govern'd by Nature and Probability. So
near is their Affinity, that by a very natural and common
Metaphor, Poetry is said to paint Things,
Painting to describe them. Both give us <i>Draughts</i>
of the Body, as well as the Soul; but with this Difference,
that the former is chiefly expressed by Painting,
the latter by Poetry. It cannot be denied, but
that the Lines of a Face are much more strongly
distinguish'd by Light and Shade, than by any Colouring
of Words, tho' ever so elegant, or well chosen:
Add, moreover, that the Attitudes, the various
Positions and Gestures of the Body, the confused
Rout and Tumult of a Battle, the Gloominess or
Brightness of a Landscape, the Prospect of a Building,
and the like, are represented to much greater
Perfection by Painters, than Poets; tho', in these
Particulars, Description approaches nearer to Painting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
than in Portraitures. The Reason of these Advantages
of the Painter's over the Poet's Art, is obvious;
for as the Things represented are the Objects
of the Senses, to the Senses Painting exhibits the Images
of them, as well as to the Imagination, and that
according to the exactest Rules of Optics and Proportion:
Whereas the Poet can only apply to the
inward Faculties of the Soul, by the fainter Helps of
Words and Sound, of Memory and Recollection.
In Verse, indeed, we find these Things wonderfully
described, and every Way agreeably to Nature; and
tho' it is impossible for Words to represent them to
the Mind, as graphically as Colours do to the Eyes;
yet perhaps less Genius is required in the one than in
the other. But the inward Springs and Movements
of the Soul, the Actions, Passions, Manners, the
distinguishing Tempers and Natures of Men, are
drawn with much more Accuracy by the Poet, than
the Painter. The one can imitate only so much of
the Passions, as appears in the outward Man, in his
Countenance, and Gesture; the other fetches them
from the inmost Recesses of the Heart, describes
them as they lurk there, without Disguise, in all their
genuine Conflicts. The Representation we see of
these, even in Painting (as far as Colours can represent
them) is exquisite, even to Admiration; but,
upon the whole, after a fair Comparison between
the two Arts, Poetry excels Painting as much as the
Soul does the Body, that being best represented by
the former, as this is by the latter.</p>

<p class="indent">Poetry, then, being a sort of <i>Imitation</i>, those that
practise the Art are not called
Ποιηἱαι, <i>Makers</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
from <i>creating</i>; as if it was their peculiar Province to produce,
out of nothing, new Matter for their Subject:
So far is this from being true, that they propose always
to copy Nature. But this Appellation is given
them by way of Eminence, as their Thoughts are
more exercised in <i>Invention</i>, and <i>forming</i> Ideas, than
any other Writer's; as such Symmetry and Harmony
is required in their Compositions; and such Artifice
in their Fictions (for they not only adorn their Subject,
but generally make it) and, lastly, such Management
and Pains in working up the Machines of
their Poem, and conducting the several Parts of it,
so as to make them all conspire to one uniform
Action. In this last Particular Poets remarkably
excel other Writers, as all that are versed in them
are sensible. But among those that are honoured
with the Title of Poets, and are such, all have not
an equal Claim to it. To the Epic and Dramatic
Writers it is more peculiarly applicable; to the rest,
only, as we term it, by Analogy. Their Business is
Invention, as well as Disposition; the rest have little
to do with the one, much less with the other. So
that there are not only different Degrees of Poets,
and subordinate Honours; but some who are called
so only in an improper Sense: For who would mention
<i>Martial</i> and <i>Virgil</i> under the same Predicament?</p>

<p class="indent">We said above, that Poetry consisted of <i>metrical
Numbers</i>: This is a necessary Part of the Definition,
as being the very Essence of Poetry, properly so called;
and tho', as we observed, there may be Verses
without a Poem, there can't be a Poem without
Verses. I am obliged, therefore, once more to dissent
from Monsieur <i>Dacier</i>; who, not, indeed, without
the Authority of others, maintains<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
that those fabulous Narratives in Prose, of <i>Lucian</i>, <i>Heliodorus</i>,
and the like, among the Ancients, and of many others
among the Moderns, that are held in so great Esteem,
in <i>France</i>, particularly, and <i>Spain</i>, are Poems. I readily
own some of them are truly elegant, and give us
ample Testimonies of the Authors Wit and Judgment;
nay, and except their want of Verse, are very
little different from Epic Poems. But if even <i>Homer</i>'s
<i>Ilias</i>, or <i>Virgil</i>'s <i>Æneis</i>, were to be stript of
their Metre, they would no longer be looked upon
as Poems; if we may judge of the Nature of a
Poem from the general Consent of Writers, who
always take it for granted that Verse is an essential
Property of it.</p>

<p class="indent">Those who are of the other Opinion, think they
are supported by no less Authority than <i>Aristotle</i>'s;
who asserts τ' εποποιιαν to consist μονον τοιϛ ψιλοιϛλογοιϛ, η τοιϛμετροιϛ.
The foremention'd learned Writer insists,
that ψιλοιϛ λογοιϛ can signify nothing else but plain
Prose; that therefore <i>Aristotle</i> admitted some sort of
Epic Poem without Metre. Others, that take the
contrary Side, endeavour to shew, that by ψιλοιϛ λογοιϛ
is to be understood a poetical Discourse, not without
Metre, but without <i>Harmony</i> and <i>Rhythm</i>; by
which <i>Aristotle</i> meant Music, and Measures which
they used to dance to. So that, according to these
Interpreters, the Particle η is not <i>disjunctive</i> in this
Place, but <i>explanatory</i>. They that would see the
Arguments in Defence of this Exposition, may consult
<i>Vossius</i><a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.
But if we grant our Opponents what they desire,
<i>viz.</i> that <i>Aristotle</i> meant only Prose by
ψιλοιϛ λογοιϛ, as indeed it is most probable he did;
yet it will not follow that he reckoned such fictitious
Narratives, as we are now speaking of, or indeed
any kind of Prose whatever, to be a Species of Poetry.
To make this plain, we must enquire into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
genuine Sense of the other Word ἑποπιἱα. Here the
<i>French</i> Interpreter supposes, without any Hesitation,
that it signifies nothing else but an Epic Poem, or
the Art of making it. But <i>Vossius</i> proves, to a Demonstration,
that it must have a larger Sense, so as to
include the Epic Poem, and that kind of Fable without
Metre, which is the Subject of our present Debate.
The Meaning, then, of <i>Aristotle</i>, is this, that
the ἑποπιἱα is the <i>Genus</i>, one Species of which is
the <i>Epic</i> Poem; the other, the <i>Novel</i>, or Fable in
Prose. Upon this View, then, we see, that granting
ψιλοιϛ λογοιϛ, in <i>Aristotle</i>, to denote only Prose; yet
it can't from thence be concluded, that these fictitious
Narratives, or any kind of Prose, can be
brought under the Head of Poetry. To the <i>Epop&oelig;ia</i>
they truly belong, and to nothing else.</p>

<p class="indent">Metre, then, we'll conclude to be an
essential Part of Poetry. Another Question arises, whether
<i>Fiction</i> is likewise so. Some tell us, that no one
should be entitled a Poet, but he that invents some
Fable, and heightens it with the Decoration of
Verse. To this Opinion I can by no means assent.
The first Writers of Verses, no doubt, made them
in Praise of somewhat that was real, and before them.
For it is highly probable, that this Art, as most others,
was in its Infancy employ'd about Things that
were most obvious, and easy to the Learner. Now
it is certainly more easy to describe a Subject that already
exists, than to form a new one. <i>Vossius</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
thinks, that Love was the first Occasion of Poetry.
Which is not improbable, considering that this Affection
is coeval with Mankind, is universal, and naturally
productive of Poetry. True Love, then, or
somewhat true, was the Poets first Theme; afterwards,
by Length of Time, they rose to Things that
were more difficult, and blended artful Devices and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Truth together. So that Poetry was before Fiction;
and even since they have been united, there have
been many Poets, truly so called, who have had to
do with Fiction. Those that exercise that Talent
with Art, are Poets in a more peculiar Manner, and
of a superior Genius. But if those only were to be
honour'd with the Title, the Number of them would
be very small. To all, therefore, it ought to extend,
who, tho' they <i>invent</i> nothing, yet <i>illustrate</i>
their Subject with Metre, animated with the Style and
Spirit of Poetry.</p>

<p class="indent">I cannot, therefore, sufficiently wonder that the
great <i>Scaliger</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
should assert, there was no Difference
between Poetry and History, except in the <i>Diction</i>.
'Tis certain he could not mean Poetry in general;
for there are many Sorts of it, which are so totally
different from History, that they have scarce any
Thing in common with it. Even the Epic Poem,
tho' it consists much in Narration, yet is distinguish'd
enough from History, by the subject Matter, by the
Disposal of the Parts, and many other Criterions.
<i>Scaliger's</i> Opinion may seem true in respect of one
kind of Poetry only, such as that of <i>Lucan</i>, which is
properly call'd an Historical Poem: Tho' this may
be heighten'd with that poetic Rage and Fire, which,
I presume, is somewhat more than <i>Diction</i>, and
incompatible with History.</p>

<p class="indent">Tho' we generally use the Words <i>Poesis</i> and
<i>Poetica</i>, <i>Poesy</i> and <i>Poetry</i>, indiscriminately; yet,
if we would speak properly, they ought to be distinguish'd.
By a <i>Poem</i> (a third Word, that often occurs in this
sort of Dissertations) is meant the Work of the Poet;
by <i>Poesy</i>, the actual Exercise; by <i>Poetry</i>, the Art or Habit.</p>

<p class="indent">And since Harmony and Sonorousness are so necessary
a Part of Poetry, it may not be foreign to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
our Purpose to compare it with Music; especially as
these two entertaining Arts are not only nearly allied
in their Nature, but in Fact also, often united: This
we see, especially in Odes and Songs, and the Entertainments
of the Theatre; where Poesy and Music
lend each other their friendly Aid, become joint Associates,
and both conspire to captivate their Hearers.
In this, also, they farther agree, that they have both
the same Admirers. I speak of such as have made
a Progress in Letters; for we often meet not only
with Lovers of Music, but Masters in it, that, for
want of Learning, have no Taste for the Pleasures
of Poetry. But among those that are advanced in
Literature, an Admirer of one of these Arts, loves
the other also; and he that understands one, has a
Knowledge in both, or desires and wishes for it.
From hence it was, no doubt, that the Ancients
made the same <i>Apollo</i> the Patron of Poetry and Music,
and attributed to the Muses the divinest Melody,
adorning them with the Ensigns of the Harp,
and other musical Instruments. <i>Aristotle</i>, likewise,
seems to have comprehended Music under Poetry;
and tho' that may not be altogether so proper, since
Music consists of Sound only, without Words, yet
it is plain the Affinity between them is very great.
Both charm the Ear with sonorous Measures; Music,
indeed, in a higher Degree, but Poetry comes
much nearer to it in this Respect, than Prose, how
flowing or tuneable soever.</p>

<p class="indent">Both turn more particularly upon the Harmony of
the Parts, and the proper Disposal of them; both
suited to Men of the politest Taste, and both
improve it. In short, so nearly are they the same,
that the Word <i>Singing</i> is equally applied to both. But
this Difference there is, that Poetry is much the
more excellent in its kind; because the whole Circle
of Learning enters into its Composition; it applies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
itself more particularly to the Soul, as the other to
the Senses; and, lastly, the Advantages of it to Mankind
are abundantly greater.</p>

<p class="indent">From hence I am naturally led to enquire into
the Use and End of Poetry, which is generally
reckoned twofold, <i>viz.</i> to <i>instruct</i> and to <i>please</i>.
So that we come now to the last Branch of our Definition,
wherein we asserted, that Poetry was design'd
<i>for the Pleasure and Improvement of Mankind</i>, according
to that well known Saying of <i>Horace</i>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Aut prodesse volunt, aut delectare Poetæ.</i><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A Poet shou'd instruct, or please, or both.</span>
<span class="i32"><i>Roscom.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">It is agreed, then, by all, that this is the
twofold End of Poetry; but which the principal, is still a Doubt.
It may bear a Dispute, indeed, which is in <i>Fact</i> the
principal; but which <i>ought</i> to be so, surely can be
none: For in this, as in all other Arts, the Advantage
ought to be considered before the Pleasure.
Some, indeed, of our modern Writers, think otherwise;
and boldly pronounce Pleasure to be the chief
End of Poetry. It can't be denied, but this Opinion
is perfectly consonant to their Writings; in which
they not only principally consult their Reader's Pleasure,
but in Opposition to their Advantage. Witness
those lewd Poems with which this divine Art is polluted.
But if we would consult Reason, we should allow
that even in Verse what improves us, ought to be
more regarded than what delights us. I own, the severest
Wits, that lay down the most rigid Precepts
of Virtue, ought to have a View to Pleasure in their
Compositions; for it is the distinguishing Mark of
the Poet from the Philosopher, that tho' Virtue is
the Aim of both, yet the one presses it closer, indeed,
but in a less engaging Manner. In the dry Method
of a Teacher he defines his Subject, he explains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
his Terms, and then gives you Rules; the other
cloaths his Precepts in Examples, and imperceptibly
insinuates them under the beautiful Disguise of Narration.
I own, likewise, that Readers are generally
more sensible of the Pleasure they receive, than the
Profit, even when it is less proposed by the Writers;
for it is That makes the strongest Impression upon
the Imagination: Nay, and I grant, that this is what
Writers themselves ought to study. Yet notwithstanding
all this, Profit may be the chief End of
Poetry, and ought to be so; but for that very Reason
Pleasure should be joined to it, and accompany
it, as a Handmaid, to minister to its Occasions.
When Children are allured with the sweeten'd
Draught, or gilded Pill, they, as the Physician intended,
consider nothing but the Beauty of the
one, or the Taste of the other: But it is well known,
this was not the <i>chief</i> Intent of the Physician
in his Prescription.</p>

<p class="indent">This Rule relates principally to the more
perfect and sublimer Kinds of Poetry, and especially the
Epic and Dramatic. For we don't pretend that Epigram,
Elegy, Songs, and the like, conduce much
to the Improvement of Virtue. It is enough, if
these Writings keep within the Bounds of Chastity,
and give no Offence to Good-manners. Poets
sometimes write, not so much to move others Passions,
as to indulge their own. And as Pleasure is
the chief, or, perhaps, the only <i>Effect</i> of this sort
of Levities, so it may very innocently be proposed
by Authors as the chief <i>End</i> of them. Tho' even
from these lesser Flights one Advantage arises, that
they improve the Wit, and polish the style, both of
the Writer and the Reader; a Circumstance that
may be observed in Favour of all Kinds of Poetry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">If it be asked, What are those inward Sensations
of Pleasure with which Poetry affects us, or from whence
it is Mankind are so highly delighted with that Way
of Writing; I answer, this may in some Measure be
collected from what has been already said, and farther,
from what we shall have Occasion to say hereafter
under the subject Matter of Poetry. At present
let the following Considerations suffice: It is obvious
enough why Harmony of Verse should please us,
since that's a Pleasure that arises from a proper Disposition
of Sounds, which make their Way directly
to the Senses. But still we feel a much higher, from
the Images of Things beautifully painted, and strongly
impressed upon the Mind. As we are naturally desirous
of Truth, we are glad to find our Ideas confirmed
by those of others; for from thence we conclude
ours are just, and agreeable to Nature. This
Assimilation of Ideas is still more pleasant, when it
arises from some sudden unforeseen Impression; for
all Impressions upon the Mind, whether of Joy or
Grief, are more affecting, the swifter they are made,
and the more unexpected; the slower they are, the
more languid. This is confirmed no less by Experience,
than Reason. Since the Impressions, then,
of Poetry, are of the vehement kind, it is no Wonder
so much Pleasure should attend them, especially
when the Ideas we speak of are heighten'd with all
the Elegance of Expression. This Pleasure is likewise
in some Measure to be attributed to the natural
Love of Mankind for Imitation, the Reason of which
we shall attempt to give in its proper Place. From
these Principles we may account for the Pleasure
that arises from Description, as well as that from Fiction.</p>

<p class="indent">The Pleasure we receive from the Variety
of Thought, and sudden Transitions in Poetry, seems
owing to our natural Love of Novelty; for so imperfect
is the Happiness of us Mortals, that every
Thing by Constancy grows nauseous and insipid to us.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">With Regard to the Passions, why some of
them should give us greater Pleasure, the more they are
put in Motion, is plain; but how Delight should
flow from Pity, Terror, and even Sorrow itself,
seems truly wonderful, and difficult to account for.
And, indeed, to do Justice to this Question, we
ought to know the secret Springs of the Soul, and to
lay open the Foundations of human Happiness and
Misery: Which, because it will require a distinct
Dissertation, we shall pass by, at present; reserving
it for a more full Enquiry, when we come to treat
more particularly of the Nature of Tragedy.</p>

<p class="indent">We have already, in a few Words, shewn,
wherein the Advantages of Poetry consist; no one can be a
Stranger to them: This Art will receive no less Honour,
if we look back into its Antiquity. If it took
its Rise from Love, (the Opinion, which, in Conformity
with <i>Vossius</i>, we have above proposed as most
probable) yet to Religion it owes its Increase and
Progress; and it may be question'd, which of the
two is its true Parent. <i>Dacier</i> calls it the Offspring
of Religion; and it is certain, in the earliest Ages of
the World it was usual to sing Hymns to the Honour
of God upon the solemn Festivals; upon those especially,
when after the In-gathering of Harvest they
offer'd up to him the First-fruits, and prais'd him
for the Blessings they were now in Possession of. In
Course of Time, Poetry, which had hitherto depended
wholly upon Nature, and knew not the
Name of Art, by the Corruption of Mankind grew
itself corrupted. To bring it back to its Purity, it was
the Care of the wiser Part of Men to lay it under
certain Laws and Regulations. From hence arose
the <i>Art</i> of Poetry.
\<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
It is a great Dispute among the Learned, what
Nation produced the first Poets. The <i>Greeks</i>, who
to their own refined Taste ascribe the Origin of all
Learning and Arts, laid Claim, likewise, to this, and
instanced in <i>Orpheus</i>, <i>Linus</i>, and <i>Musæus</i>, as the
first Poets. But <i>Vossius</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
proves it very probable that this Triumvirate of Poetry never existed;
and that they are not proper, but common Names, derived
from the old <i>Ph&oelig;nician</i> Language. Be that as it will,
(for I am little disposed to engage in so minute a
Controversy) I agree with the same <i>Vossius</i>, that Shepherds
(I may add, or Husbandmen) found out the
Use of Poetry; and that they lived in <i>Greece</i>, near
those celebrated Mountains and Springs, <i>Helicon</i>,
<i>Parnassus</i>, <i>Aganippe</i>, <i>Hippocrene</i>, <i>Pirene</i>, and
the like, that were therefore sacred to the Muses and
<i>Apollo</i>. But still it does not appear, that Poetry
owes its first Original to the <i>Greeks</i>, (for, as the
forementioned learned Author goes on<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>)
"if we examine this Matter by the Scripture, we shall
find the People of God, the first Inhabitants of
the Earth, from whom all Nations are descended,
have the best Title to this Honour. Poetry flourished
among the <i>Israelites</i>, not only before the
<i>Trojan War</i>, but before the coming of <i>Cadmus</i>
into <i>B&oelig;otia</i>, who first taught the <i>Greeks</i> the
Use of Letters. And tho' we were utterly ignorant of
what is mentioned concerning the <i>Hebrew</i> Poetry,
yet the Antiquity of Music would teach us that
the Original of Verse must be owing to the Oriental
Nations; for little Doubt is to be made but
Singing begun in the very Infancy of the World.
This is farther confirmed, from what we read of
<i>Jubal</i>, the seventh from <i>Adam</i>, who is styled the
Father of such as handle the Harp and Organ.
Antiently, then, Musicians and Poets were the same."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">But to examine still farther into the Origin
of Poetry, (for what we have hitherto said relates only to
the <i>Subject</i>, and the <i>Authors</i>, not to the immediate
<i>Occasion</i> of it:) Now this seems to be owing to the
Love implanted in Mankind of <i>Imitation</i> and <i>Harmony</i>.
<i>Vossius</i> very undeservedly ascribes it to the
three following Causes, <i>viz. Nature</i>, an <i>Attempt</i> to
write Verse, and <i>a finish'd Skill</i>. By <i>Nature</i> he understands
not only the ἑνφνἱα, or Happiness of Parts,
but the ὁεμἡ, the Impetus, usually styled the Poetic
Fire. I am very sensible of the Advantage of these,
and of their Necessity to constitute a good Poet;
but much doubt whether they are to be reckoned
(what he and I both speak of) the efficient Causes
of Poetry. No one can <i>excel</i> in Poetry, without a
Genius peculiarly turn'd for it; but the Question is,
what <i>general</i> Reason can be assign'd, that gives all
Men, even those that have no Talent for it, as well
as those that have, a natural Inclination to it. As to
the poetic Fire, it may be reckoned a Concomitant
of Poetry, but not the Cause of it. No more can
an Attempt to write Verses, which is rather the
Thing itself in its first State of Imperfection; much
less can the Perfection of any Thing be the Cause
of its being perfected; that's absurd, and a mere
Contradiction in Terms.</p>

<p class="indent">The Reason, then, of the Thing in
Question, must be fetch'd from the Love of Imitation and
Harmony. To this Principle it is owing, that among
the most barbarous Part of Mankind we meet with
Attempts in Painting, Music, and Poetry. For it is
a great Mistake to think that these Arts are consistent
only with such refin'd Nations as are Mistresses
of all other Arts: No, they are Things of an universal
Nature, and agreeable, as it were, to all Mankind,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
from the very Composition of their Being.
Only with this Difference, that in those Parts of the
World where Learning and Manners are cultivated,
these Arts are nurtur'd, and rise in Perfection; but
where the People are rude, and unpolished, they
suffer in the common Calamity of the Place. But
still, even there, the Seeds shoot forth; witness those
barbarous, uncouth Songs, the mean Instruments of
Music, and imperfect Sketches in Painting, which
are found, according to the Relation of Travellers,
among the <i>Indians</i>, and almost Savage People of the North.</p>

<p class="indent">This Fondness of Mankind for imitating,
proceeds, probably, from nothing else but their Desire
of <i>Knowledge</i> and <i>Power</i>. To produce something
out of nothing, is the peculiar Property of the Almighty:
As Man, therefore, cannot create, it is his
Ambition to approach as near to the Exercise of that
Power, as his Nature will allow him; and that can be
only by imitating Things already made.</p>

<p class="indent">His Passion for Harmony is no Wonder; because
whatever we call beautiful arises from a just Proportion,
and proper Arrangement of its Parts. It is
this composes the whole Frame of the Universe;
and the more perfect every Individual of it is, the
greater Share of Harmony it possesses.</p>

<p class="indent">So much for the Original and Cause of Poetry.
Of its Antiquity, in Comparison of Prose, I need say
but very little, since that seems, beyond all Doubt,
to have been prior to it, in Point of Time, tho' behind
it in Dignity. Some, indeed, have asserted,
that Poetry was the ancienter, out of a Zeal, I suppose,
to its Honour, which needs no false Supports:
But this Opinion is by no means credible. 'Tis certain,
all Learners proceed, as Nature directs them,
from the plainest and easiest Things, to those that
are more compounded and difficult: For Men to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
speak Verse before Prose, is the same as if they
should pretend to run, or dance, before they could
stand, or walk. It is a very weak Argument, with
which <i>Strabo</i> (as <i>Vossius</i> cites it) endeavours to
maintain the contrary Opinion. To prove Verse the ancientest
Way of Writing, he observes, that Prose is
styled <i>Oratio Pedestris</i>, [as if we should say creeping
Prose.] "Now Speech was carried, before it ventured
to walk. <i>Vossius</i> artfully replies, that it was
called <i>Pedestris</i>, not because Men against Nature
condescended to it, but because they mounted
above it, as it were, and left it upon the Earth:
For Prose seems to creep, when compared with
the Loftiness of Poetry. Now, to retort the Argument,
there's no Doubt but Men walk'd first,
before they ventured on Horseback." If any one
would see more of this, he may consult <i>Vossius</i>. That
Poetry, as an Art, flourish'd before Oratory, or that
the celebrated Professors of the one are not so ancient
as those of the other, is clear from History;
but that Men spoke Verse before Prose, is past all
Credit, or Probability.</p>

<p class="indent">If any Question should arise about the Prevalence
of Nature and Art in Poetry, I cannot answer it better
than in the Words of <i>Horace</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Natura fieret laudabile carmen, an arte,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Quæsitum est; Ego nec studium sine divite vena,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nec rude quid prosit video ingenium; alterius sic</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Altera poscit opem res, &amp; conjurat amice.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Some think, that Poets may be form'd by Art,</span>
<span class="i0">Others maintain, that Nature makes them so.</span>
<span class="i0">I neither see what Art without a Vein,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor Wit without the Help of Art can do;</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">But if this is the Case, whence comes that
Saying so common in every one's Mouth, <i>That a Man must be
born, not made a Poet</i>; whereas, in <i>Horace's</i> Judgment,
a Man is both born and made so? In answer
to this, No more to be sure is intended by the Proverb,
than that Strength of Genius enters more into
the Composition of a Poet, than the Refinements of
Art; tho' both are necessary to the forming him a
great one. Writings that betray a true poetic Spirit,
how unpolish'd soever they are, extort from us
Praise and Admiration; but those that are cold and
lifeless, tho' form'd upon the most scrupulous Observation
of the Laws of Poetry, are neglected, or condemn'd.
The Sloth or Inaccuracy of the one, demands
our Censure; but the stupid Rigidness, and
labour'd Dulness of the other, provokes at once our
Rage, our Hate, and Disdain. It is of little Consequence
that <i>Horace</i> seems to put these upon the Foot
of Equality. A Poet that lays down general Rules
in Verse, and in so short a Compass, cannot be supposed
to enter minutely into every Distinction. Besides,
the Saying above may be true in this Respect;
that Poetry <i>especially</i>, and beyond all other Sciences,
requires a Fecundity of Nature; and besides such a
<i>peculiar</i> Turn of Wit, as is <i>seldom</i> found,
and <i>few</i> are blest with.</p>

<p class="indent">And this is partly the Reason, why Poets were
said to be <i>inspired</i>; partly, I say, for the chief Reason
is probably owing to that Fire, or more than,
human Impulse, called by the <i>Greeks</i> ἑνθυσιασμἱϛ,
which distinguishes them from other Writers.
That this was no real Inspiration in the ancient
Poets, (except in those sacred ones that communicated
God's Will to Mankind) nor is now so in
the Moderns, I suppose needs no Proof; but it is
certain, however, that not only the Poets said it was,
but the Heathens, also, thought it divine. Hence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
arose that more than common Reverence, the Populace
paid to them. Hence the Title given of
them of <i>sacred</i>, and <i>divine</i>. Hence that solemn
Invocation of the Muses and <i>Apollo</i>, and sometimes
other Deities, with which the Poets, and the Poets
only, introduce their Works.</p>

<p class="indent">I have no Inclination to spend my Time in
examining into the Fables which have long since become
an Appendage to Poetry, nor to search out the hidden
Meaning of them: I leave that Task to those
whom we call the Mythologists; let them, if they
please, explain the Allegory of the two Tops of <i>Parnassus</i>,
of the Number Nine among the Muses, the
Mystery of the Wings of <i>Pegasus</i>, and of the Fountains
rising at the Stroke of his Hoof. These, I
would only observe, are the Stains of Poetry, contracted
from the Corruption of Heathenism, which
infected Religion no less with its trifling Puerilities;
and it is but just that we, upon whom the clearer
Light of Truth has shone, should at length learn to
despise such ridiculous Tales, which, by Repetition,
are now grown nauseous; and to refine Poetry, as
well as true Religion, from the Dross and Alloy of Falshood.</p>

<p class="indent">There are some other Things, of less
Moment, which I shall pass over with barely mentioning.
Poets had anciently Crowns of Laurel and Ivy, to
denote by those Ever-greens the Immortality they
gain to themselves, and confer on others. Mountains,
Groves, and Springs, were sacred to the Muses,
because Poets naturally fly from the Noise and
Tumult of the City, to the peaceful Solitude of the
Country; that so, disengaged from Care and Interruption,
they may dedicate the utmost Efforts of
Nature to their beloved Profession: Besides,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Carmina secessum scribentis, &amp; otia quærunt</i><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>:</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Leisure and green Retreats the Poets court.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Because Verse flows naturally there, and the Fancy is
strangely awaken'd into Poetry with the Pleasures of Solitude around it.</p>

<p class="indent">Lastly, Another Question may possibly be ask'd,
and deservedly too, (for it is a Matter of some Importance
to know) how far Poetry and Oratory agree,
and wherein they differ. To give a direct Answer to
this, we say, that Eloquence is common to both;
Eloquence, therefore, ought to be consider'd as twofold;
that of Oratory, and that of Poetry. Those
Things that come under the Title of Eloquence in
general, relate to both Arts; such as, Topicks of
Praise, whether of Persons, Facts, or Things; Topicks
of Exhortation, Congratulation, Consolation,
and the like, with which the Orator, as well as the
Poet, excites Anger, Love, Pity, and all other Passions.
Both observe alike a proper Decorum of
Manners, according to Age, Fortune, and Condition
of Life. Ardent Expressions, and lively
Thoughts, are the Embellishments of both. In
both the Diction is elevated, or familiar, grave, florid,
or strong, as Occasion serves. For all these
Things, as I said before, are Branches of Eloquence
in general, are drawn from the same Heads of Invention,
and illustrated by Examples fetch'd from
Orators or Poets. So that it is impossible almost for
him that treats of one of these Arts, not to mention
some Things that are in common to both. However,
the Difference between them is very great;
and Poetry has several other Characteristics besides
that of Metre; a Style, for instance, peculiar to itself,
Fiction, copious Descriptions, poetic Fire, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
(to add no more) a certain Licence, denied to Orators,
in the due Exercise of which the Poet's Art is
chiefly conspicuous. These are all worthy an accurate
and distinct Consideration, and such an one
hereafter, perhaps, they may come under.</p>

<p class="indent space-below">The technical Measure of Verses, and the
different Sorts of them, I leave to the Grammarians,
whose Business it is to scan Syllables, to weigh Dactyls
and Spondees, Trochees and Iambics; to teach
the Difference between Heroic, Elegiac, Alcaic,
Sapphic, Anapæstic Verse, and many others, with
which the fruitful Field of Poetry abounds: Not
that these Things are to be despised: but only as they
are more proper to be taught in the School, than the
University. It is not my Business to dwell upon so
barren a Soil, or to trifle my Time about the Externals
of Poetry; but to enter into the Spirit of it,
and make Things, not Words, the Subject of my Enquiries.

<h2>LECTURE IV, V, VI, VII.<br />
<small><i>Of the Style of Poetry.</i></small></h2>
<hr class="r65" />

<p class="indent">My present Design being to give some
Account of the Thought and Diction peculiar to Poets,
I must first premise, that there are many Things
relating to this Subject, which Words can scarce
come up to, and are much better conceived than
expressed. Every one will be satisfied of this, that
considers of how delicate a Nature Poetry is; how
variously it diversifies both Words and Things, by
such Bounds as have a very close Connection, upon
which, however, the Beauty of the Thought and
Diction often turns<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.
These, tho' clearly enough distinguished
in the Mind; yet, such is the Weakness
of Words, can never be explained in Writing. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
true Judgment, duly exercised in reading the best
Poets, and in making proper Reflections upon them,
is the only Means of arriving at this Part of Knowledge.
The outer Lines of it, which afford proper
Matter for a Dissertation, I shall endeavour to represent
to you, as well as I can.</p>

<p class="indent">But I would here, likewise, farther observe,
that Writing and Thinking are (at least ought to be) so
nearly allied, that it is impossible for any one, in
treating of <i>Style</i>, not to mention some Things that
relate to <i>Thought</i> likewise. This, therefore, will be
my Case. At present, however, I shall confine my
self <i>chiefly</i> to the former, reserving the latter for
another intire Dissertation.</p>

<p class="indent">By Style I understand a Method of
Writing peculiar to every Writer, Art, or Science; or that
which distinguishes Writings and Writers from one
another. The Beauty of it consists in such a proper
Choice of Words, and in so apt a Connexion of
them, as may express the Conceptions of the Mind
clearly, and at the same Time cloathed with a becoming
Dignity. The Style of Poetry is extremely
various; because every Species of this divine Art has
a Diction proper to itself; we shall just touch upon
the several Kinds in this Dissertation, as we shall
treat more fully, perhaps, of each, when we come to
examine them separately. Our chief Business, at present,
is, to speak of the Style of Poetry in <i>general</i>,
and shew wherein the Difference consists between
that and Prose.</p>

<p class="indent">Now this is so great, that the Poets use
many Phrases, even with the greatest Elegance, which a
Prose Writer could not, without the Imputation of
false <i>Latin</i>, or the Guilt of Solecism. Instances
of such Expressions, reducible to no certain Rule,
are very frequent. To mention only a few: Adjectives
and Participles that describe the Situation or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Part of the Body, very elegantly require the following
Noun to be put in the accusative Case, in Imitation
of the <i>Greek</i> Construction; v.g. <i>Stratus membra
sub arbuto</i>; <i>Ære caput refulgens</i>; <i>saucius ora</i>;
<i>Lacerum crudeliter ora</i>, and the like<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.
</p>

<p class="indent">Adjectives of the Neuter Gender, and singular
Number, and sometimes of the plural, are used adverbially.
So, <i>Triste micans</i>; <i>Dulce ridentem Lalagen
amabo, dulce loquentem</i>; <i>Cometa ferale rubens</i>;
<i>torva tuentem, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Many Adjectives govern a Genitive, in a Manner
altogether poetical. <i>Irritus incepti</i>; <i>non modicus voti</i>;
<i>melior dextræ</i>; <i>Pubes læta laborum</i>; <i>egregius linguæ</i>;
<i>Pravus togæ, inglorius ausi</i>; <i>anhelus laboris</i>;
<i>integer vitæ scelerisque purus</i>; <i>lassus maris &amp; viarum,
militiæque</i>; <i>seri studiorum</i>; <i>fortunatus laborum</i>;
<i>fessi rerum</i>; <i>trepidi rerum</i>; and numberless others of
the same Sort. Often, likewise, and with no less
Elegance, they govern an Infinitive: <i>Orpheus blandus
ducere quercus</i>; <i>superare pugnis nobilis</i>; <i>celer sequi;
vultus nimium lubricus aspici</i>; <i>durus componere
versus</i>; <i>Adria facilis moveri</i>; <i>fortis tractare serpentes</i>;
<i>doctus Ph&oelig;bi dicere laudes</i>; <i>cantare periti</i>; and the like.</p>

<p>Adjectives, and their Substantives, denoting Number
and Multitude, are used in the singular Number:
As, <i>Populus frequens</i>; <i>multa rosa</i>; <i>innumera avis</i>;
<i>quam multo repetet Græcia milite</i>; <i>licet illi plurima
manet lacrima</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">To mention but one Observation more:
Some Adjectives, which in common Prose agree with
their Substantives, are turned into the Neuter Gender
and plural Number, and the Substantives into
the Genitive Case: As, <i>Ultima mundi</i>; <i>ardua montis</i>;
<i>cuncta terrarum</i>; <i>prospera rerum</i>; <i>dura rerum</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
<i>aspera ponti</i>; <i>acuta belli</i>; <i>strata viarum</i>;
<i>opaca locorum</i>; and many more to the like Purpose.</p>

<p class="indent">It would be endless, to produce all the
Examples that come under these Rules; they abound in every
Page almost of the best Poets, especially the <i>Lyric:</i>
For the <i>Lyrics</i> chiefly delight in the true poetic
Style, as may be collected from the Examples I have
here produced, most of them from the Odes of <i>Horace</i>.
But there are, besides, various poetical Expressions,
which tho' not reducible to any particular
Class, yet occur up and down in Reading, and are
worthy of treasuring up in the Memory. Such are
frequent in <i>Virgil</i>:</p>

<p class="indent">I shall omit any more Examples; tho' what
I have hitherto laid before you, I dare say, have brought
their own Reward with them, as they are true Specimens
of poetic Elegance, and abundantly illustrate
what I had to say upon this Head. To alledge all
that relate to it, would be only to transcribe the
greatest Part of the best Poets. And as the Beauty
of the poetic Style chiefly consists in its own Peculiarities,
those that would thoroughly understand it,
must endeavour, with Diligence and Application, to
make it familiar to them.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor is the Style of Poetry distinct from Oratory
in <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> only; the same Difference runs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
thro' all Tongues, both modern and ancient, <i>English</i>
as well as foreign. To this is owing that Difficulty,
which the Learners of a new Language complain of
much more in reading the Poets, than the Prose
Writers. The Reason why the former use such a
Variety of Style so remote from that of the latter,
seems to be owing to this; that as Poetry requires a
peculiar Way of Thinking, it affects, likewise, a peculiar
Manner of Writing and Speaking, that so it
may be set off at as great a Distance from Prose as
possible. Besides, as it is confined within the strict
Rules of Measure, it is but just to allow it a greater
Liberty of Diction, and so compensate, in some Degree,
that Inconvenience with this Advantage.</p>

<p class="indent">The Expressions I have hitherto produced
are purely poetical, which, beautiful as they are in Verse,
if once resolved into Prose, become flat and insipid;
you would acknowledge them, indeed, to be poetical
Materials, but rudely scattered, and disjointed; and,
as <i>Horace</i> describes it,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;<i>Invenias disjecti membra Poetæ</i><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dissected Fragments of a Poet's Limbs.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Other Phrases there are, which tho' not
merely poetical, yet are much more suitable to Verse than
Prose: They may well enough be used sparingly, and
with Caution, by an Orator, or an Historian; but if
they occur frequently, they are Blemishes in his Composition,
and mere Affectation. Of this Stamp are,
<i>Campus pinguis sanguine</i>; the Field now sated with
Blood: <i>Vela vento turgida</i>; the turgid Sails: <i>Duces
sordidi pulvere honesto</i>, or <i>non indecora</i>; with honourable
Dust besmeared; and the like.</p>

<p class="indent">But tho' the Expressions above, that are
purely poetical, or that are chiefly so, conduce much to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Beauty of a Poem, yet good Verse may be made of
those only that are common to all Kinds of Writing.
For Proof of this one Example shall suffice,
from the Odes of <i>Horace</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sæpius ventis agitatur ingens</i><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Pinus, &amp; celsæ graviore casu</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Decidunt turres, feriuntque summos</i></span>
<span class="i6"><i>Fulmina montes.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Storms often vex the stately Oak,</span>
<span class="i0">High Mountains feel the Thunder's Stroke;</span>
<span class="i0">And lofty Tow'rs, when Winds prevail,</span>
<span class="i0">Are ruin'd with the greater Fall.</span>
<span class="i30"><i>Creech.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">In these Verses, tho' truly beautiful, there
is not somuch as one Phrase, not one Word, but what might
with Propriety be used in Prose. It is observable,
however, that even these, and the like Expressions,
when transposed, and taken out of Metre, lose all
their Elegance: For tho' every Word, considered in
itself, is agreeable to either Style, yet there is somewhat
so distinguishing in the poetical, as throws a
Beauty upon Words, which, out of Metre, would
appear insipid, or absurd; and yet, tho' we are sensible
of the Thing, it is impossible to assign a Reason for it.</p>

<p class="indent">Another Peculiarity there is in the Style
of Poetry, that a Thing is often express'd, not by Name,
but by some concomitamt Circumstance, or Adjunct
belonging to it; by which Means the Mind is led on
to an entire Conception of it, by pleasing Intervals,
as it were, and a successive Gradation of Thought.

<p class="indent">These, perhaps, and the like, might be reduced
to the Head of Descriptions; but they are very short and
imperfect ones, and, if I may so speak, are from
their very Imperfection the more perfect. The
Mind of Man does not love to have every Thing
too minutely laid before it; it pleases itself in having
Room for Exercise, and to walk alone, as it were,
without leading.</p>

<p class="indent">There are many other Things, which Poets chuse
to express paraphrastically, and in short Descriptions,
rather than in simple Terms. Every Body is acquainted
with the usual little Images they give us (the
larger ones I have at present nothing to do with) of
the Morning, Night, Noon, and Evening; as</p>

<p class="indent">A Passage, this, entirely poetical, and not
only beautiful in itself, but more proper to convey an Idea of
the Thing intended, than all that the Power of Oratory can furnish.</p>

<p class="indent">To the Style of Poetry <i>Descriptions</i>
likewise are almost peculiar. 'Tis true, they occur frequently
in Prose; but then they are used either with Impropriety,
or with Caution; or the Writings themselves
are of a Kind that borders near upon Poetry, and
therefore borrows Descriptions from it. Historians,
indeed, describe Things, Places, and Persons; but
not so much for the Sake of Ornament, as Necessity;
that the Series of their Narration may appear
clear and perspicuous to their Readers. Orators
likewise attempt Descriptions, when they have
Occasion for them to work upon the Passions. But
neither the one nor the other affect them as a Decoration
to their Writings, which Poets generally do
very successfully, making use of these sort of Colourings,
either of general Things or Particulars, in
Miniature or at full Length, as Occasion serves, not
only with a Design to move the Passions, but to
please the Fancy. Great Judgment is required in the
due Exercise of this Art, and a puerile Wit never betrays
itself more apparently, than by forcing in Descriptions,
out of mere Ostentation, that have no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Connection with the Subject, and are consequently
a Burden to it. But nothing is more beautiful,
when a proper Choice is made of them; nothing
more agreeable to the Nature of Poetry; few
Things more peculiar to it. A Prose Writer does
not only on Purpose use fewer Descriptions than the
Poet, but in Reality is less capable of them. The
very Essence of Poetry consists chiefly in Imitation;
and such a Power it has in placing Things before
the Eye of the Reader, as Prose entirely wants;
and can be conceived only, not expressed<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.
An Historian might record the Omens and Prodigies
that attended the Death of <i>Julius Cæsar</i>; but it is
impossible he should come up to that admirable Description
of them <i>Virgil</i> has left us. He might recount,
for instance, the surprizing Eruption of Mount
<i>Ætna</i>; but could never find out Words to represent
it in so lively Colours as these,</p>

consulting the Oracle:</p>

<p class="indent">Among the other fatal Predictions of

<p class="indent">From the whole, I suppose it abundantly plain,
that there is an Energy in the poetic Style, as it is much more
adapted to copying Nature, than Oratory is, with all its Rhetoric.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>Fifth Lecture.</i></b></div>

<p class="indent">'Tis farther to be observed, that
figurative Expressions are far more frequent in
Poetry, than Prose, as they are far more
suitable to it; because it consists much more in the
Embellishments of Style, in the Liveliness of Description,
and impressing the Images of Things upon
the Imagination. For tho' it rejects all false Colouring,
and too great Affectation of Pomp, yet from the
very Nature of it we may judge it takes in more real
Ornaments than Prose. As to <i>Tropes</i> or <i>Figures</i>, as
they are usually called, many of them are never
used in Oratory, some but seldom, and very sparingly;
others, again, agree naturally with it, particularly,
the <i>Irony</i>, <i>Metonymy</i>, <i>Synechdoche</i>, and
<i>Metaphor</i>. Tho' the last of these, for the Reason before
alledg'd, is more the Property of Poetry. Some of
the Figures are so familiar, and natural, that they are
every Day used in common Speech, even by the Vulgar,
of which Sort we may reckon those above, and
some others. Metaphors never fail of being beautiful,
when applied with mature Judgment, and a
lively Wit; that is, when they are drawn from Nature,
connect Ideas that have a due Relation to each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
other, and are not too much wrested to a foreign
Sense. But nothing is more insipid, more ridiculous,
or absurd, when these Rules are transgress'd in
the Choice of them; which is the Case, very often,
of our modern Writers, to their eternal Disgrace.</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing can shew more the Elegance of
Metaphors, and their Agreement with Nature, than those
that are taken from Men and living Creatures, and
applied to Trees and Plants. For as these have a sort
of Life ascrib'd to them (call'd the vegetative) and
are really endued with it; the Transition is easy to
Creatures of a higher Rank, that are endued with it
in a more proper Sense. Hence we hear so often,
not only among the Poets, but in Prose, and even in
common Conversation, of Trees and Plants being
<i>alive</i> or <i>dead</i>, <i>healthy</i> or <i>sickly</i>. Nay,
often human Passions and Affections are attributed to them:
Plants, in particular (to omit other Instances) are
often said to <i>love</i> or <i>hate</i> this Soil or that. So
<i>Virgil</i>, speaking of them,</p>

<p class="indent">There are many other Metaphors of different Kinds,
which tho' they may seem, as indeed they are, a little
of the boldest, yet are agreeable to Nature, and
true Elegance. As that of <i>Virgil</i>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">An Iron Tempest, and a Storm of Darts</span>
<span class="i0">Hovers aloft, and blackens all the Sky.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">These lofty Metaphors, however, are to be
used with great Judgment, for fear they should seem too far
fetch'd, and the Style more swelling than weighty.</p>

<p class="indent">As I am now upon the Subject of Figures,
I can't help making a Remark or two on those Books of
Rhetorick that are usually read in Schools. They
contain, indeed, many Things of Use, and worthy
of Observation: But surely there's no Necessity
that an Art designed for the Refinement of the Minds
of Youth, should be treated of in so rough a Method,
so full of dry, logical Definitions, as must be
hard for Boys to understand, and much harder to remember.
Nor is there any Need of all those Sub-divisions
of Figures, one under another, which,
when Boys have once made themselves Masters of,
before they have Judgment enough to use them,
they think their Business is to adorn their little
Performances with these sort of Flowers, as they call
them, and fling them in, at any Rate, without any
Regard to Propriety: Their Style, by being thus overcharged,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
as it were, instead of appearing with fresh
Vigour, abounds only with disagreeable Excrescencies.
A Knowledge of these Things will be much
better arrived at by Experience, than Precept: And
every one that is conversant with the best Authors,
that reads them with Understanding, and true Relish,
cannot but be acquainted with all the Figures of
Speech, and the Art of using them, tho' he never
heard so much as their Names, or their Definitions.</p>

<p class="indent">It is common with all Sorts of Writers
to express the same Thing by different Modes of Speech, and
such Variety is often reckoned a Proof of their Elegance.
Now Poets have in this Particular a greater
Liberty allow'd them, than any other Writers, for
the Reason I have often mention'd, because their
Works consist more in Ornament and Decoration.
But the Exercise of this Liberty ought to be conducted
with great Judgment and Caution; lest, by
an ill Use of it, the Style grow too luxuriant. The
just Medium, and the vicious Extreme, cannot be
better learnt than by making a Comparison between
<i>Virgil</i> and <i>Ovid</i>. Both of them, you'll see, express
the same Thought different Ways; the one never
fails of Beauty, the other falsly aims at it. <i>Ovid</i> tells
you the very same Thing, in many Words, and sometimes
with very little Difference between them:
<i>Virgil</i> illustrates one Thing in <i>general</i>, by distinguishing
its several Species or Adjuncts, and his Description
of each is perfectly new. A few Examples, out

how tedious seem the Trifles, and how nauseous the Repetitions

said, the same Thing, or the same Thought, by different

Species, by changing the Words only; from which
superabundant Luxuriance, as his Style must needs
want Nerves, so must his Readers Patience. I
would not, however, condemn it throughout; he

<p class="indent">I hope I shall deserve your Pardon for
producing these Examples; they are of no ordinary Nature,
for that very Reason because their Subject is so. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
know very well, how absurd it would be to repeat to
you, upon this Head, all the beautiful Passages that
occur in the best Poets: What else would this be,
but to transcribe the greatest Part of them? But I
thought it not improper to give you these Specimens
from the <i>Georgics</i>, that you might view in them the
Force of Poetry and <i>Virgil</i>, who was able to throw
such a Splendor upon so mean Materials, and make
them at once the Pleasure and Envy of Posterity.</p>

<p class="indent">To shun the Repetition of the same Words, as
much as possible, is a Precept not only applicable to
Poets, but to all other Writers; because the same
Sounds tire the Ears of the Reader. Here those Figures
of Elegance, the <i>Epizeuxis</i> and <i>Anadiplosis</i>,
are manifestly excepted. Some, however, out of a
Detestation of this Fault, fall into a greater; and in
their Zeal for Variety, by wresting Words from their
natural Signification, are guilty of the very worst
Fault in Writing, Obscurity. The best Writers never
run into this Extreme, but chuse rather to repeat
the same Words, than use others in an improper
Sense, as may be seen very frequently in <i>Virgil</i>. It
is probable, indeed, a Desire of Elegance first
brought in a Diversity of Words; for if Convenience
only were considered, each Conception of
the Mind would have but a single Word appropriated
to it: Whereas now, in learning a new Language,
to our great Trouble we find many Words
affixed to one Idea, or many Ideas to one Word.
Nor is Disagreeableness of Sound to be avoided only
in the Repetition of the same Words, but often (for
the Rule does not always hold) in using different
Words of the same Termination. As these in <i>Juvenal</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;<i>tarda per densa cadavera prorâ.</i></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">'Tis certain, in poetical Compositions we
ought to have great Regard to Harmony, and to endeavour
to captivate the Ear, as well as please the Imagination
of our Readers. For tho' nothing is more
contemptible than <i>versus inopes rerum, nugæque canoræ,
poor shallow Verse, mere bubbling Trifles</i>, that
have no other Recommendation but Sound; yet
they err, on the other Hand, who have a View only
to the Sense, and none to the Musick that should echo
to it. This was the Case of many of our Countrymen,
of <i>Couley</i>, particularly, and others of the last Age;
who, studious only for the Beauty of Thought, neglected,
or did not rightly understand the Melody of
Verse: Till at length our <i>Dryden</i> arose, who added
to <i>English</i> Poetry what it only wanted, Numbers,
Harmony, and Accuracy; by which Means, if we
are not too partial in our Judgment of ourselves, it
now bears the Laurel from all the Nations in <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The best Poets among the Antients were
solicitous about the Disposal of their Words, as well as
the Choice of them. It is an Elegance, which, tho'
often unobserved, pleases the Mind insensibly. And
yet any one, with the least Attention, will perceive,
that there's not a little Difference, whether the same
Word is placed in one Part of a Verse, or another.
How much, for Instance; would that of <i>Virgil</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Admonet in somnis, &amp; turbida terret imago</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>suffer in the Change, if it were read,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;<i>&amp; imago turbida terret!</i></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Various Examples there are, of this Sort,
which it would be needless to alledge. But I would here
observe, that the Harmony of Verse does not only
consist in its being free from all Asperity, and flowing
gently with one steddy Course: Some Asperity
is often necessary; a Poem may labour for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Want of, and offend the Ears even with its Smoothness.
Many, therefore, much wrong their Judgment,
who prefer <i>Ovid</i>, <i>Claudian</i>, and others, to <i>Virgil</i>,
on this Account; because, forsooth, they find less Roughness
in their Verse: Whereas the very Want of this
is their Defect; and <i>Virgil</i> does not more excel them
in Versification, than in every other Requisite of a
good Poet. He is generally harmonious, full, and
fluent; and if he does not always keep one even
Tenor, this is not owing to any Inability, but, as we
observed before, in another Particular, the Effect of
his Choice. He knew it would be more grateful to
his Reader to change, now and then, the usual
Smoothness of Style, and mix with it somewhat of
an agreeable Harshness. His Periods, likewise, he
concludes very variously; generally, indeed, where
the Verse ends, but often in different Parts of it,
with this Foot or that, as the Sound requires. In
the Conduct of this Variety, of as small a Moment
as it may seem, there's no little Labour, nor less
Elegance. It is rarely aimed at by <i>Ovid</i>, <i>Claudian</i>,
<i>Statius</i>, and the rest, who fall short of <i>Virgil</i> in
that boasted Sweetness of Verse, whenever his Subject
demands it of him. It is a great Mistake to think
<i>Ovid</i>'s Negligence is a Matter of Merit, and that his
Verses flow with the more Ease, for his Want of
Care in their Composition; because, as it is urged,
they are not so much the Effect of Study, as of Nature.
Every Excellence in Writing must proceed
from both; the more a Poem is laboured, the more
natural it shall often seem; and its Stiffness may be
owing to Neglect. To illustrate what I have said of
<i>Virgil</i>, by one Example, out of many: In which of
the abovemention'd Poets shall we find any Lines,
I will not say that exceed in Harmony and Softness
his Description of <i>Orpheus</i> and <i>Eurydice</i>, but come
near it? The whole is sweet; but nothing can be
more so than the following Part of it.

<p class="indent">How the Verse labours! <i>Conati imponere&mdash;Pelio
Ossam</i>&mdash;Without any Elision of the Vowels, it moves
on with Difficulty, and totters, as it were, with an unweildy
Load, to represent to us the stupendous Image
of the straining of the Giants. In the Words, <i>atque
Ossæ frondosum involvere Olympum</i>, there seems to be
a Redundancy of Syllables, and we see in them the
enormous Superstructure rise higher and higher, by
one Layer of Mountains heaped upon another.</p>

<p class="indent">Since, then, it is the Nature of Poetry to
express the Things it describes by the very Sound of the
Verse; how little Share of the Spirit of it have they,
who, by an unnatural Constraint, smother their
Thoughts with Words that are dumb to the Sense?
And yet this is a Fault many are guilty of; who will
set before you a rapid Torrent in the slow Length
of an <i>Alexandrine</i>; rural Pleasures, in Words that
represent the Clangor of a Trumpet; the Din of
War, with the soft and easy Strain of Elegy; the
Triumphs of Love, with the rough and unpolish'd
Address of a Clown; and debase this divine Art with
a thousand such Contradictions. A Lover of <i>Virgil</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
that reads him with Discernment, will never fall into
these, and the like Enormities; for which Reason,
'tis from him I produced the several Examples that
have illustrated each Part of this Dissertation. No
one can have Reason to complain of their Number;
for nothing else could have so display'd the hidden
Charms of Poetry. Let me recommend it, therefore,
to my young Audience, who are fired with the
Love of so engaging an Art, to make him the Bent
of all their Care and Application; let <i>Virgil</i> be
often in your Hand, and never out of your Thoughts,</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>Sixth Lecture.</i></b></div>

<p class="indent space-above">It is a common Opinion, that those
mutilated Verses that occur up and down in
the <i>Æneis</i>, were left so by the Author out
of Design, and to add a certain Beauty to his Style.
I am rather inclined to think them the Marks of an
imperfect Work, and that they would have been
fill'd up by the Author, if he had put his last Hand
to that divine Performance. It is an agreed Point,
that the <i>Georgics</i> are more correct than the <i>Æneis</i>;
now in them we don't find any of these Mutilations,
and in the <i>Æneis</i> one that leaves the Sense imperfect.
In a Place or two, indeed, some seeming Reason
may be assign'd for this sudden breaking off; <i>viz.</i> to
represent more naturally the Thing in Description.
As in this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
<i>Italiam non sponte sequor</i>&mdash;&mdash;</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Tis with Regret I seek</span>
<span class="i0">Th' <i>Italian</i> Coasts.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Tho' even here, I would observe by the Way, the
unalterable Resolution of <i>Æneas</i>, and his abrupt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
leaving the Queen, might have been express'd as
well, if his Speech had ended where it does now,
and the Verse been continued on afterwards. It is
certain, no good Account can be given of most of
these <i>Hiatus's</i>; and therefore it is very difficult to
find out the Elegance of them. There may be a
Grace, possibly, in some seeming Defects; as in those
false Quantities, which <i>Virgil</i> sometimes, but sparingly
admits, to awaken in his Reader an Attention
to the Rules of Poetry, by so becoming a Violation
of them. But tho' a Lisp, a Mole, or a slight Cast
of the Eye, may add new Beauties to the Beautiful,
Lameness and Deformity never can.</p>

<p class="indent">But whatever is the Determination concerning
<i>Virgil</i> (for I would not be too peremptory in mine)
modern Writers, and especially those of our own
Country, take, undoubtedly, too great a Liberty in
imitating him, who purposely leave many half Lines,
both in their <i>English</i> and <i>Latin</i> Poems. This
is often but an Indulgence of their Sloth; sometimes of
their Want of Words, or of Wit; they leave part
of a Verse, because they know not how to finish it;
and sometimes, perhaps, it is owing to an Affectation
of Elegance. To me, I must confess, these Gaps, in
Reading, are always offensive; not to say absurd and
ridiculous. But so it is, they receive a Sanction, it
seems, from the Authority of <i>Virgil</i>. Allowing he
left some designedly, it does not follow our Writers
have a Pretence to the same Liberty. They shall
have it in abundance, if they'll attempt another
<i>Æneis</i>. In the mean Time, I would have them
consider a little the Difference between a Poetical
Essay, and an Epic Poem; or if that be their Attempt,
the Difference, still, between theirs and <i>Virgil</i>'s.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor are they guilty of less Presumption, who, under
the sacred Name of <i>Virgil</i>, arrogantly transgress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the Laws of Quantity. In the Course of a long
Work, that requires the greatest Nicety and Conduct,
such a Liberty, when used with Caution and
Modesty, is not only excuseable, but elegant: But
what is this to our little poetical Businesses? In vain
is <i>Virgil</i> here alledg'd, of all Authorities the greatest,
or <i>Cæsura</i>, of all Figures the usefullest! 'Tis true,
that immortal Poet uses this License sometimes, not
only in the <i>Æneis</i>, but in the <i>Georgics</i>, and even in
the <i>Eclogues</i>: The Prince of Poets, and the great
Arbiter of Verse, might claim a discretionary Power
of suspending the Laws of it, as he saw Occasion;
but for us to invade his Prerogative, under Pretence
of imitating his Example, is the same as if a Subject
should usurp the Authority of a King, and justify
himself by that very Authority. We are not, however,
totally debarr'd this Liberty; nor yet indulged
it in the same Degree with <i>Virgil</i>; much less ought
we to extend it beyond him.</p>

<p class="indent">Scarce any Thing is of greater Difficulty,
or Moment, in the poetic Style, than the true Use of Epithets.
Nothing loads a Poem, or tires the Reader
more, than too great a Redundancy of them. Now
they are always redundant, unless their Substantives
receive from them either new Ideas, or some Illustration
and Ornament too of their own. And yet
with the Observation of these Rules, it is possible
they may be redundant, that is, a Poem may be
clogg'd with too many of them. I shall lay before
you some Examples of both Kinds of Epithets; and
shall take Care to make Choice of such as may not
only illustrate the Point before us, but many other
Beauties of the poetic Style.</p>

<p class="indent">Of the former Sort of Epithets, that add
new and distinct Ideas to their Substantives, the following
Verses will furnish many. In <i>Virgil</i>'s most admirable
Description of the Plague raging among the
Cattle, in the third Book of the Georgics, we have these Lines:

<i>cunctantes ministros, equus infelix studiorum, ardentes
oculi, aspera lingua, defixa aratra, &amp;c.</i> add a new
Idea, quite distinct from the general Nature of the
Substantive, and rising from the special Adjuncts and
Circumstances of the Thing described.</p>

<p class="indent">The second Sort of Epithets are those, that are
not so distant from the general Nature of the Substantives,
and yet not perfectly coincident with it;

new Ideas. As in the abovemention'd Description of <i>Virgil</i>:</p>

<span class="i0">The noisy Tempests, and reluctant Winds.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">In <i>timidi damæ, cervi fugaces</i>, and <i>tempestates
sonoras</i>, the Epithets we see are of near Affinity with
the Substantives; for they express some Adjuncts, or
Properties, which are always inherent in them.
Therefore are of a different Kind from <i>tristis aratror,
natantia lumina, invalidas palmas</i>, and the rest
above cited, that exhibit Ideas totally distinct from
the universal Nature of the Subject, and agree with
it only <i>pro hic &amp; nunc</i>, as the Schoolmen speak.
The Epithets of this distinct Kind entertain the Mind
with a more agreeable Variety; but those of the
other require, perhaps, more Care and Judgment in
the proper Choice of them: For tho' they border
upon the general Nature of their Substantives, expressing,
as we said, some of their inherent Qualities;
yet, we likewise observed, they don't perfectly coincide
with them, but express an Idea somewhat
different, and yet not totally so. These Expressions,
for Instance, the <i>fearful Deer</i>, and the <i>loud Tempests</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
are not like those Absurdities we shall have Occasion
hereafter to expose; such as <i>burning Fire</i>, <i>cold Ice</i>,
which are but other Words for <i>hot Heat</i>, and <i>cold
Cold</i>; but represent to us some <i>special</i>, and less
<i>essential</i> Adjuncts of their Substantives; and therefore
are not to be indiscriminately used upon every Occasion,
but then only, when they are agreeable to the
Nature of the Subject. For Instance, because <i>Virgil</i>
has said, the <i>fearful Deer</i>, and <i>flitting Stags</i>, it
by no means follows that these Epithets are always
applicable, whenever <i>Stags</i> or <i>Deer</i> shall happen to
be mention'd. In the Place he used them, they were
proper, because the Wonder of what he was describing
turn'd wholly upon the Circumstance they describe,
<i>viz.</i> that the Plague, which was common to all the
Beasts, brought them all to such an Equality and
Unanimity, that even those that were by Nature
<i>fearful</i>, and formed for <i>Flight</i>, associated with such
as lived upon Rapine and Slaughter. So, again, because
the same Author has <i>Luctantes ventos, tempestatesque
sonoras</i>, we are not to conclude we may
use the same Epithets, with the same Words, at any
Time. He made Choice of them to remind his
Reader of the Difficulty of <i>Æolus</i>'s Province to restrain
the Impetuosity of the boisterous Winds.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon this Occasion, I cannot but think,
the <i>Gradus ad Parnassum</i>, and other Books of that Stamp,
no small Prejudice to Learners. Here Boys meet
with Heaps of undistinguish'd Epithets, and synonymous
Words, before they are come to Maturity
of Judgment to make a proper Choice of them;
and consequently blindly pick out such as the <i>Hiatus</i>
of the Verse requires, with little Regard to Sense,
and less to Propriety and Elegance. By relying upon
these Helps, they give themselves up to Sloth, their
Ideas are confounded, and their Judgments corrupted.
The Patrons of these sort of Books have nothing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
urge in their Defence, but that by facilitating the
Scholar's Pains, they allure him to that Study, which
he would otherwise have declined, on account of its
Difficulty. But, before these Helps were thought of,
Poetry was in as flourishing a Condition as in our
Time; and it seems much more adviseable for the
Boys to receive all proper Assistances from their Master,
or School-fellows, than from these <i>Fasciculi</i>.
To banish them from the Schools, would only have
this Consequence; that it would put the Youth upon
reading the best Poets, in order to whet their Imagination,
and ripen their Judgment. If these Books
are to any allowable, let them be indulged, not to
Boys, but to confirm'd Poets, who have Judgment
enough to select proper Words out of them. But to
these such childish Helps are contemptible. All
Things, therefore, consider'd, it would be no Disadvantage
to Poetry, if the <i>Gradus ad Parnassum, Flores
Poetarum, Elegantiæ Poeticæ</i>, and the other <i>Thesaurus's</i>
of this Nature, were committed to the
Flames, or for ever buried in Oblivion. But to return:</p>

<p class="indent">There are other Epithets, of so <i>general</i> a Nature,
that in all <i>poetical Descriptions</i> they are <i>always</i>
applicable to their Substantives, and yet are different
from those I just now mention'd, that <i>perfectly coincide</i>
with them. As in <i>Virgil</i>:</p>

<p class="indent">These are the general Rules, and such as are
rarely or never to be transgress'd, in the Choice of Epithets:
But to insert them only to fill up a Verse,
when they are entirely idle and useless, and the Description
is neither advanced, heightened, or illustrated
by them, is the greatest Fault almost a Writer can
be guilty of. From hence the Style is <i>barren</i> and
<i>jejune</i>; the Sense <i>relax'd</i> and <i>enervated</i>.
And yet this Fault, great as it is, not only Boys, but some
even of the Ancients, and many of our modern Writers,
run into. <i>Buchanan</i>, in his Paraphrastical Version
of the Psalms, has these Verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>

<span class="i0"><i>Fluminis ad liquidas forte sedemus aquas.</i></span>

<p class="indent">Two Lines after he goes on thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Flevimus, &amp; gemitus luctantia verba repressit,</i></span>
<span class="i5"><i>Inque sinus liquidæ decidit imber aquæ.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">We had no Occasion to be reminded <i>once</i>, much less
<i>twice</i> in the Compass of five Verses, that <i>Water</i>
was <i>liquid</i>; 'tis a Circumstance that served as little
for the Information of the Reader, as for the Illustration
of what the Poet was describing. <i>Ovid</i> is
often guilty this Way; as in the following Verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="indent">To produce more Instances, would be needless:
One small Scruple, I confess, arises to me upon this
Head, from observing that <i>Horace</i> and <i>Virgil</i>
seem to use some few of these redundant Epithets; and 'twas
for this Reason I said above, the Rule I had laid
down ought <i>rarely</i> or <i>never</i> to be violated.
But whatever we determine concerning those great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Authorities (for I know not how to impeach them) it is
certain they very sparingly allow themselves this Liberty;
and the Writers, perhaps, of that Age, paid so
great a Veneration to <i>Homer</i>, that they sometimes
affected even to imitate his Faults. Notwithstanding,
therefore, this Exception, (and what Rule is
without one?) I may venture to affirm, that the Laws
I proposed, in relation to Epithets, ought punctually
to be observed. It is farther to be noted, that the
Words <i>meus</i>, <i>tuus</i>, and <i>suus</i>, (which are not
properly Epithets) are often brought into a Verse out of Idleness,
only to fill it up, and make it flat and languid.
Thus <i>Ovid</i>, in the Story of <i>Phaeton</i>,</p>

<p class="indent">These are Difficulties I only propose, not presuming
to assert any Thing against the ancientest, and almost the Prince of Poets.</p>

<p class="indent">On the other Hand, they are under no less an
Error, that will admit only of <i>very few Epithets</i>, and
arrogantly banish the Use of them. It is certain,
they are not only wonderfully adapted to Description,
but so peculiarly to Poetry, that the Beauty of
its Style chiefly consists in them. They exhibit to
the Mind Ideas of <i>Qualities in the Concrete</i>, (as the
Logicians speak) which strike the Imagination no
less than those that are express'd in the <i>Abstract</i>.
'Tis plain, from what appears above, that the Writings
of the best Poets are full of them, and particularly
<i>Virgil</i>'s. But tho' the Examples already alleg'd
might seem sufficient, yet I beg Leave to add
a very remarkable one, where every Substantive has
its proper Epithet, to heighten and adorn the Sense.
The Passage I mean is at the Beginning of the celebrated
Description of the Infernal Shades:</p>

<p class="indent">A Style, therefore, destitute of Epithets, will
gain no more Admirers, than a Body made up of nothing but

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
just Proportion of these sort of Adjuncts, when they
are neither wanting, nor too much abound. Verbs
and Substantives I suppose to be in Style, what Bones
and Nerves are in a Body; because they contain
more Strength, tho' not more Beauty than Epithets;
which therefore, whenever Emphasis and Energy is
required, are totally omitted. Thus <i>Virgil</i>:</p>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">The last Verse is express'd with all the
Strength and Weight imaginable, because without one Epithet.
The Reason of this Effect seems to be, that Ideas
in the <i>Concrete</i> are no more than Adjuncts of those
in the <i>Abstract</i>; now that which supports, must
needs be stronger than what is supported. To the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
same Purpose, when this is our Aim, all synonymous
Expressions must be avoided; for the shorter and
closer the Style, the stronger; but the Matter of it,
by being spread among a Variety of Words, is thinned,
and, consequently, weakened. The Poet, no doubt,
is indulged much more in Epithets and Synonyma's,
than the Orator; his Province consisting more peculiarly
in Colouring, Description and Decoration.
But both of them ought to take Care that these musical
and bewitching Elegances are not too redundant;
for a Style, whether in Prose or Verse, cannot
be attended with a greater Fault than a verbose Luxuriance.</p>

<p class="indent">Some, thro' Ignorance of what an <i>Epithet</i>
is, may be apt in their Reading to make a wrong Enumeration
of them; for all <i>Adjectives</i> and <i>Participles</i> do
not (as many think) come under this Appellation,
but those only which are annex'd to Substantives, by
way of <i>Ornament</i> and <i>Illustration</i>; not such as make
up the essential Part of the Description. In the following
Lines of <i>Virgil</i>,</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>Seventh Lecture.</i></b></div>

<p class="indent">We come now to enumerate the different
Kinds of Style made use of by Poets,
and to shew briefly wherein they consist,
and to what sort of Verse and Subject each is suitable.
To begin, then, with that which is first in
Dignity, and therefore ought to be so in Place; the
<i>sublime</i>, I mean, whose Property it is to express lofty
Ideas in no vulgar Strain, but with Words sonorous,
pompous, and majestic. This Style is, in the first
Place, proper for the Epic Poem; in the next, to
some sort of Odes; after that, to Tragedy; then to
the severer kind of Satire; and, in short, to all Poems
of less Note, that partake of the Heroic, or the
Buskin. There are others that make Excursions into
it, such as the <i>Georgics</i>, and all of the Didactic, or
Philosophical Kind, whenever they digress into a
more noble Field of Matter, to which their Subject
sometimes naturally leads them. But to Comedy,
the lower kind of Satire, and Pastoral, it is never
agreeable; to Elegy very seldom. In behalf of the
first of these, that Place of <i>Terence</i> will be urged,
which <i>Horace</i> seems to have had in his View, when he says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
<i>Interdum tamen &amp; vocem Com&oelig;dia tollit.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet Comedy sometimes may raise her Voice.</span>
<span class="i37"><i>Rosc.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>But this Rage of <i>Chremes</i>, which <i>Horace</i>
mentions, is not, perhaps, so much an Instance of a Comic Sublime,
as of a borrowed Tragic Fury. In relation
to Pastoral, if <i>Virgil</i>'s fourth Eclogue be objected, I
answer, that the Poet himself confesses he leaves his
proper Subject for a more lofty one, and begins his
Poem with a sort of an Apology for it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sicelides Musæ, paulo majora canamus;</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Non omnes arbusta juvant, humilesque myricæ.</i></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Sicilian</i> Muses, raise a loftier Strain;</span>
<span class="i0">Not all in Groves and lowly Shrubs delight.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Not that I suppose Pastoral totally to reject the
Sublime, as I shall have Occasion to shew more fully hereafter.</p>

<p class="indent">For the present, I suppose, it will suffice to
produce one or two Instances, out of innumerable, of
the Style we are upon. In the second <i>Æneid</i>, <i>Venus</i>,
shewing her Son what Gods were united for the Destruction
of <i>Troy</i>, gives us this Specimen of it:</p>

<p>Between the Sublime of <i>Virgil</i> and <i>Claudian</i> there's a
manifest Difference; the Ideas of the latter are not
so just, nor the Diction so pure: He can only be
said to be less faulty, when he writes best.</p>

<p class="indent">'Tis a remarkable Property of this Style, to be
bold and figurative; to abound, especially, with Metaphors
and Hyperboles; the Use of which requires
great Care and Judgment. It is distinguish'd, on the
one Hand, from the turgid, rumbling Bombast,
which is much affected by those who are possess'd
with a false Spirit of Poetry, and no true Judgment
to direct it; and consists either of empty sounding
Words, or unnatural Sentences, or absurd Metaphors,
or rash Hyperbole's. There are innumerable
Examples of it in <i>Claudian</i>; <i>v. g.</i></p>

with this hard and unnatural Way of Writing.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Sublime</i>, on the other Hand, is distinguished
from the <i>Humble</i>; which has its Elegance as it is used
in its proper Place. It is proper, when we would
describe, in a familiar and easy Manner, the common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Concerns of Life; and agrees more especially with
Comedy, the lower kind of Satire, and Epistles;
and, as Occasion serves, may be admitted in all
Sorts of Poems. Instances of it are very numerous:</p>

</div></div>

<p>It is needless to add any more: <i>Terence</i>'s Comedies,
and <i>Horace</i>'s Satires and Epistles, consist entirely
almost of this Style, and are abundant Proof of its Elegance.</p>

<p class="indent">The Style of Pastorals is likewise of the
humble Kind, but still distinct from what I have now been
instancing in. The one, as I said, is suited to Comedy,
Satire, and Epistles; the other to Bucolics:
The former represents common Life, and more especially
as it appears within the City; the latter
draws all its Images from the Country; that looser
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
and freer, this sweeter and more elaborate. But of
these Things more hereafter, when we come to treat
of this delightful Species of Poetry separately. At
present let it be observ'd, that there is a middle Kind
of Style between the Sublime and the Humble, suitable to every
Branch of Poetry. This of <i>Ovid</i> is a Specimen of it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
<i>Arma gravi numero, violentaque tela parabam</i></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Edere, materia conveniente modis.</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Par erat inferior versus; risisse Cupido</i></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Dicitur, atque unum surripuisse pedem.</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Quis tibi, sæve Puer, dedit hoc in carmina juris?</i></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Pieridum vates, non tua turba, sumus.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whilst I to sing in lofty Verse prepare,</span>
<span class="i0">The bloody Triumphs of destructive War,</span>
<span class="i0">The Urchin <i>Cupid</i> mock'd my rash Design,</span>
<span class="i0">And stole one Foot from each alternate Line.</span>
<span class="i0">But who, my Boy, gave thou this great Command?</span>
<span class="i0">We are the Muses, not the Lovers Band.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Innumerable are the Instances of this middle Style
among the Poets, especially in <i>Virgil</i>'s <i>Georgics</i>,
which are chiefly writ in that Way. For it is to be
particularly observ'd, that, because the Matter of a
Poem is low, it by no means follows the Thoughts
and Diction must be so too, and that there's no necessary
Connexion between a common Subject and a
vulgar Style. To prescribe Rules for Sowing, Harvest,
and other Matters of Husbandry, is a slight
Subject, but not therefore to be treated with the
Unpoliteness of a Clown. Tho' the Poem be preceptive
in its Nature, it may be elegant in its Manner;
it may be employ'd upon Things of small Moment,
yet they may be cloath'd with Ornament, and
heighten'd by Description. But Comedy, and the
looser kind of Satire, as they regard only the Manners
of Men in common Life, are chiefly adapted to the low Style.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">It then becomes faulty, when any Thing of a sublime
Nature, at least above the common Level, is
introduced with some low creeping Expression.
Thus <i>Ovid</i>, where he speaks of the Council of the Gods:</p>

<span class="i0"><i>Carminibus grates, &amp; Diis auctoribus horum.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You secret Transports on your Charms bestow,</span>
<span class="i0">And on the Gods, the Authors of them, too.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Nothing can be more palpable than the Absurdities I
have here produced: In <i>Ovid</i> they are almost unpardonable,
who, as he wanted not Genius, must
needs have fallen into them thro' gross Inadvertency
and Supineness.</p>

<p class="indent">There's another Species of Style, called the
<i>Sarcastical</i> and <i>Invective</i>, suited, as Reason will
tell us, more peculiarly to Satire. But we shall no where
find a more lively Instance of it than in <i>Virgil</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
<i>Cantando Tu illum? aut unquam tibi fistula cera</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Juncta fuit? non tu in triviis, indocte, solebas</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Stridenti miserum stipula disperdere carmen?</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou him in piping! Had'st thou e'er a Pipe</span>
<span class="i0">Jointed with Wax?. Wert thou not wont, thou Dolt,</span>
<span class="i0">In the Cross-ways, upon a screeching Straw</span>
<span class="i0">To murder a vile Tune with viler Notes?</span>
</div></div>

<p>Here, it is plain, the Mordacity lies in the Expression
more than the Thought; which is no more than
that the Shepherd mention'd was a miserable Piper;
but the Words are emphatically cutting,
<i>in triviis, stridenti, miserum, stipula, disperdere</i>;
each of which is arm'd with Poignancy, and dresses out the
Image with fresh Ridicule. On the other Hand, sometimes
the Invective turns wholly upon the Thought;
as in another Verse of <i>Virgil</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
<i>Qui Bavium non odit, amet tua carmina, Mævi.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who hates not <i>Bavius</i>, be he doom'd to love</span>
<span class="i0">Thy Metre, <i>Mævius</i>!</span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
A keener Satire cannot be conceived; but the Force
of it consists in the Sense only; the Words, considered
separately, have nothing of that Kind in them.
The former, therefore, is the proper Instance of the
Invective Style; because in the Style the whole Invective
is contained. It may justly be wonder'd that
I should fetch Examples of the <i>Style</i> and <i>Thought</i> of
Satire, from a Poet endow'd by Nature with the
sweetest Disposition, and led by his Subject to a very
different Way of Writing: But he had a Genius so
adapted to every Thing, that he could write Satire in
spite of his own good Nature. These Examples are
a sufficient Proof, that if he had turn'd his Thoughts
that Way, he would have gain'd the Laurel from all
other Competitors; and I must ingenuously confess,
that, in my Mind, <i>Juvenal</i> himself has nothing more
severe than this <i>Virgilian</i> Acrimony.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Florid</i> Style is set off with Tropes,
Figures, and especially Metaphors. The Use and Abuse of
these, I have already spoke of; to avoid Repetition,
therefore, I would here only observe, That all Sorts
of Poems admit of figurative Expressions, and receive
fresh Ornament from them, when the Subject
requires them, and Judgment is used in the Choice
of them; but that this Style is suitable, in the first
Place, to the sublimer Kind of <i>Ode</i>, and, in the
next, to the <i>Epic</i> Poem.</p>

<p class="indent">A Style, likewise, is said to be easy or strong;
short or diffuse; clear or obscure; sweet, soft, and fluent;
or rough, and unpleasant. The several Properties of
these, to what Subject, and to what Poem each is
suitable, may be collected from this Dissertation, and
the Examples produced; and are partly so self-evident,
that all further Explication or Example would
be needless. I only observe, in one Word, that a
clear Style is never faulty, an obscure and an uncouth
one always so; but that the easy or strong, the short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
or prolix, the loose or close, the brisk or slow, the
sweet and soft, or the rough and harsh, are all of them
sometimes proper, sometimes improper, according
to the Subject Matter of the Poem they appear in.
'Tis farther to be observ'd, That the rough Style, artfully
enrich'd with a few antiquated Words, has a
certain Majesty in it, which adds a Grandeur to
Tragedy especially, and a Sublimity to the Epic
Poem: That this Liberty, however, is to be used
with Judgment and Caution, lest it appear dull and
stiff, instead of lofty and majestic. On the other
Hand, that Elegies, particularly, and some sort of Pastorals,
require the sweet and flowing Style, and utterly
reject all Asperity: Lastly, That some of the
Appellations by which Style is distinguish'd are applied
to Thought likewise; as <i>sublime</i>, <i>low</i>, <i>satirical</i>,
<i>elegant</i>, &amp;c. and some of them not so: For a <i>brisk</i>
or <i>slow Thought</i>, a <i>concise</i> or <i>prolix Thought</i>, &amp;c.
are Terms which the Schools are yet Strangers to.</p>

<p class="indent">Elegance enters into the Composition of
every Style that has any Merit in it, pervades every Part,
and is, as it were, the Soul to it. What Elegance is,
and wherein it consists, has been already shewn, at
the Entrance of this Dissertation.</p>

<p class="indent">But tho' every Kind of Poem has a Style peculiar
to itself, yet we are not to preserve one even Course
of Writing from the Beginning to the End, but to
rise or fall, to be sweet or rough, to be concise or to
expatiate, <i>&amp;c.</i> according to the Variety of Matter
into which our Subject leads us. <i>Virgil</i>, in that
Description of Prodigies which I have before cited,
sometimes uses the short Diction:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>It is a great Fault, to be always upon the Sublime:
In those Poems, whose Subject leads them to be most
so, some Things occur, that ought to be express'd in

require the lofty or the splendid.</p>

<p class="indent">Lastly, 'tis to be observed, that the Style
of <i>Comedy</i> is not properly a poetical Style, but an elegant
kind of Prose. It would be absurd if it were otherwise;
since the Language of Comedy is to imitate
familiar Discourse, and such as passes in common
Conversation. For this Reason, some (as <i>Horace</i>
tells us) have made a Doubt whether this Species of
the Drama is to be accounted a Species of Poetry, or not:</p>

<p>'Tis Certain the <i>Style</i> of the ancient Comedy had
nothing poetical in it but the Feet and Measure, and
those very little different from Prose; and rejected
all those Modes of Speech, which we have mention'd
above as peculiar to Poetry. What, therefore, Comedy
has in common with Poetry, does not consist in the
Diction, but partly in the Measure, and chiefly in the
Invention, the Conduct of the Plot, and the Disposal of the Parts.</p>

<p class="indent">I am very sensible a great Question may arise in relation
to our Comedies, whether they are to be
deem'd Poems, since they want those metrical Numbers,
which in our former Dissertation we made essential
to a Poem. This Question undoubtedly
bears much harder upon our <i>English</i> Comedies, than
upon the ancient <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> ones; which are
manifestly writ in some certain Measure, tho' a loose
one, and the nearest possible to Prose; but our's
pretend to be nothing else but Prose, only with a Distich
or two at the Conclusion of every Act. It may
be question'd, likewise, on the other Hand, whether
the <i>French</i> Poets are to be commended, who write
entire Comedies not only in Ryme, but even Heroic
Verse. These Doubts I shall at present wave, since a
more proper Opportunity will offer to discuss them
fully, when I make Comedy the Subject of an entire Dissertation.</p>

<p class="indent">As <i>Style</i> is my present Subject, and I shall make
<i>Thought</i> my next; it may not be improper to inquire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
into the Relation between the Beauty of the one and
the other, and what Connexion there is between
writing well, and thinking justly, and how they mutually
conspire to promote each other. This Enquiry
is somewhat of a middle Nature between the
Subject of our present Discourse and the following; and,
like a Partition Wall, may serve to join, and yet divide them.</p>

<p class="indent">I lay it down for a Rule, that no one can
write clearly, or elegantly, that does not think so. If you
are obscure to yourself, you must have great good
Luck indeed, if you are perspicuous to others. And
if your Thought is bad, shining Language only
serves to make both ridiculous. 'Tis like dressing
up a disagreeable Person in rich Cloaths, which receive
Disgrace from the Wearer, and make his Deformity
more contemptible. On the other Hand,
'tis scarce possible, but he whose Thoughts are clear
and bright, will be so in his Style too, provided he
is well vers'd in the best Authors, and Master of the
Language he writes in. When we speak or write,
our Thoughts break forth, like the Light, diffuse
themselves around, and, by their natural Force, enter
the Minds of our Hearers or Readers, as that does
the Eyes of the Beholders. Words (if we may believe
<i>Quintilian</i>) almost necessarily follow a clear
Imagination, as the Shadow does a Substance. And
if once we have a Conception of any Thing beautiful
or sublime, suitable Expressions will arise, if we think
proper to make use of them. If we think proper, I
say, to make use of them; for it is not to be supposed,
that the one will necessarily accompany the
other, whether we will let them or not, or that <i>Quintilian</i>
meant to extend the <i>Necessity</i> so far. It is possible
the Thoughts may be beautiful and sublime,
and the Words, out of Choice, plain and simple;
and the Plainness of these may sometimes not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
shew, but add to the Sublimity of those. To this
Purpose <i>Longinus</i> cites that short Narration of the
divine Historian, as a remarkable Instance of Sublimity:
<i>And God said, Let there be Light, and there
was Light</i>. So <i>Horace</i>:</p>

<p>In which, and many other Places, the Words are
without Ornament, but the Thought sublime. Thus
Beauty sometimes appears the most amiable in its native
Charms, and unaffected Neatness: Thus Majesty
has been seen to beam forth the strongest when
all the Ensigns of it have been laid aside, and it stood
supported by its own Strength. Words, then, are to
the Thought, what Cloaths are to the Body; what
I have to say farther upon this Head, shall be illustrated
by this Comparison.</p>

<p class="indent">On the other Hand, there are many sublime
and beautiful Thoughts that require Words of the same
Nature; they appear pitiful without them, and fall
short of their proper Dignity. Witness those Instances
we have produced from <i>Ovid</i> of the creeping
Style, and many more might be produced. Thus
frequently, I may say generally, rich Attire, and
costly Ornaments, add to the Beauty even of the
most beautiful; and Kings who appear by Nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
formed for Majesty, display it usually to most Advantage,
when deck'd with the Imperial Purple.</p>

<p class="indent">But tho' the Thoughts may be beautiful
or sublime, while the Words that express them are plain
and simple; yet the Rule will not hold inverted:
Words can have neither Beauty, nor Sublimity, unless
the Thoughts have both. I mean <i>true</i> Beauty,
and <i>true</i> Sublimity; because if these are wanting in
the Thought, that Sparkling which appears in the
Diction, is only a false Light; as fine Cloaths are no
longer fine when bestowed upon some dishonest
Form; they are far from being an elegant Dress,
when they ill become the Wearer. And if the
Thought, in this Case, is not sublime, all the Magnificence
of Diction is ridiculous Affectation, and
mere Bombast. Only one Kind of Poem ought to
be excepted; which tho' it has no <i>Latin</i> Name, is
well enough known in all the modern Languages of
<i>Europe</i>: The <i>Doggrel</i> Kind I mean; which abounds
much in an ingenious Liberty of Jesting, and dressing
up little Things in pompous Words. But in all
serious Writing, this Rule holds universally.</p>

<p class="indent">But tho' beautiful Expressions cannot
make the Thought beautiful, yet they strongly recommend
its Beauty, and even improve it; as Dress and Ornament
cannot create a Face, yet they may assist its
Charms, and add to those that Nature has bestow'd
upon it. In Proof of this, I might produce innumerable
Examples that are to be met with every
where in the Writings of the best Poets. When
<i>Virgil</i> had excellently described the broken and shattered
Condition of <i>Sergestus's</i> Ship, which we mention'd
above, it was undoubtedly a beautiful Thought
to compare it working along with one Bank of Oars,
to the labour'd Motion of a wounded Serpent. But
how does the Poet heighten the Beauty of the Comparison
in the following Manner of describing it?

<p>The Thought, the Fiction, is perfectly beautiful;
but who is so blind, as not to see that these poetical
Ideas receive no small Embellishment from the Elegance
of the Expression; or so dull, as not to love
and admire both the Art and Ingenuity of the Writer?
We see, then, that the Elegance of Thought is
much promoted by that of Diction; and this is true
of all Sorts of Thought, as well the beautiful, as the
sublime, but more particularly of that which consists
of <i>Comparison</i> and <i>Description</i>. On the other
Hand, that the Elegance and Sublimity of Thought
conduces much to the Elegance and Sublimity of
Expression, is too clear to need either Proof or Example;
Thought being, as it were, the Life of Words,
and (as the Schoolmen speak) that which gives them
their <i>essential Form</i>. Upon the whole, then, beautiful
Thoughts and Expressions mutually help and
adorn each other, as a goodly Personage and a rich
Attire. Wherein consists the Beauty of Thought,
shall be the Subject of our next Enquiry.

<h2>LECTURE VIII, IX, X, XI.<br />
<small><i>Of the Beauty of Thought in Poetry; or of Elegance and Sublimity.</i></small></h2>
<hr class="r65" />

<p class="indent">In our former Dissertation we treated
of the Style of Poetry: From <i>Words</i> we pass on to
<i>Things</i>, and propose to speak of the Beauty of
Thought; to shew wherein the Elegance and Sublimity
of it consists; the Reason and Foundation of
it; and to enumerate its different Species.</p>

<p class="indent">Every one must be sensible, as well as myself,
what a difficult Subject I engage in. If therefore I sometimes
err, in so abstruse a Path, I trust I have a prevailing
Plea for your Pardon.</p>

<p class="indent">In the preceding Dissertation we have abundantly
shewn, that the <i>Diction</i> of Poetry is very different
from that of Prose; but between the <i>Thought</i> of the
one and the other (excepting only Fiction) the Difference
is not so great. What, therefore, I shall say
upon this Head, will, for the most part, be in common
both to the Poet and the Orator; for the
Beauty of Thought is generally the same, whether it
is express'd in Verse or Prose. But because Poetry
is our Province, I judged it proper to produce the
Examples that illustrate my Subject, from the Writings
of the best Poets.</p>

<p class="indent">Writers have taken much Pains to give us a complete
Definition of <i>Thought</i>; and some have openly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
declar'd, that it is not capable of a Definition.
Among these, our Countryman <i>Cowley</i> bears the first
Place, who directly asserts, that <i>Wit</i> (for that is the
Word we often use for those Expressions that are the
Effect of it) can only be defin'd in negative Terms.
But (with the Leave of the Learned) this Word,
and the Idea affix'd to it, is as capable of a positive
and adequate a Definition, as many others which we
define the most logically, and boast of having the
clearest Notion of. <i>Wit</i>, then, in the largest Sense
of the Word, seems to be nothing else, but <i>a Thought
formed so agreeably to Nature and right Reason, and
impressed upon the Mind with such Clearness, Vivacity,
and Dignity, as excites Pleasure or Admiration</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Wit</i> we take, as we said, in <i>its largest
Extent</i>. For it is not here understood in that vulgar and narrow
Sense by which it denotes only Jokes and pointed
Turns; but contains every Conception of the Mind
that is beautiful; whatever Elegance or Sublimity the
Imagination is capable of.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A Thought formed agreeably to Nature and right
Reason</i>, is, in this Definition, the <i>Genus</i>; what follows
contains the <i>Difference</i>. By the former Part of
the Definition we understand a <i>Thought that is founded
upon solid and just Principles</i>, which is twofold,
either a Thought <i>simply</i> consider'd, or a <i>beautiful</i>
Thought. Every ingenious Thought, then, is well
founded, but every Thought that is well founded, is
not an ingenious one.</p>

<p class="indent">It was necessary to make this the <i>Genus</i>
of the <i>Definition</i>, that true Wit might be distinguish'd from
false. Thoughts of real Beauty are always form'd
upon Truth, Nature, and right Reason. If they are
not built upon this Foundation, or flow from a less
noble Spring, they are to be rank'd among those
<i>false Brillants</i>, as they are term'd by our modern,
and especially the <i>French</i>, Writers, which may serve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
to please Boys, and some others of as little Judgment,
but will always be despis'd by Men of Taste, and of
Understanding, who adhere to the infallible Maxim
laid down by <i>Horace</i>:</p>

<p>Thoughts are the Images of Things, as Words are
of Thoughts; and we all know that Images and
Pictures are only so far true, as they are true Representations
of Men and Things. Those Passages in
<i>Virgil</i>, <i>Terræque, urbesque recedunt</i>, and the like,
where Things are represented not as they <i>are</i>, but as
they <i>seem</i> to be, are no Objection to what I advance.
For Poets, as well as Painters, think it their Business
to take the Likeness of Things from their Appearance.
When they do this, their Thoughts are just,
according to the strictest Rules of Reason; for in
Description or Painting that is <i>truly</i> express'd, which
is express'd as the Thing <i>appears</i> to be. Neither
<i>Metaphors</i>, <i>Hyperboles</i>, <i>Ironies</i>, nor even
<i>equivocal</i> Expressions, when properly used, nor <i>Fiction</i>
or <i>Fable</i>, are any Deviation from this Rule of right
Thinking: For there is a wide Difference between
<i>Falseness</i> and <i>Fiction</i>, between that which is
<i>truly</i> false, (if I may so speak) and that which is only so
in Appearance. Tropes and Fictions are raised, as it
were, upon the Foundation of right Reason. Truth
is the Basis of them, and receives new Lustre from
such airy Disguises. All this will be sufficiently plain
in the Sequel of this Dissertation, and from the Examples
to be produced in it. But, in the first Place,
it may not be improper to give one or two Instances
of false Wit; that so we may settle the Difference
between what is true, and counterfeit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">We frequently meet with Passages that want
even common Sense, and yet have somewhat of a ridiculous
Brightness in them. A certain Poet gives us
a miserable Description of the Fate of <i>Pyramus</i> and
<i>Thisbe</i>, and tells us, that the Sword, when died with
the <i>Blood</i> of the unhappy Lover, blush'd, from a
Consciousness of its Crime. No,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> rather let the
unhappy Writer blush, from a deep Sense of that
Elegance which Boys would be asham'd to own.
Another of the same Form, I know not his Name,
tells us, that Lovers always abound with Wit, because
<i>Venus</i> sprung from the <i>salt</i> Ocean. It would be
endless to mention all the Turns of this sort, which
take their Rise from the feign'd Names or Adjuncts
of the Heathen Deities.</p>

<p class="indent">Modern Writers, all over <i>Europe</i>, are many
of them wonderfully fond of these sort of Trifles, especially
in their Epigrams and Love-Verses. And
some cannot refrain from them even in their larger
Compositions. Several of our Top Poets of the
former Age, (for in the present these kind of Witticisms
are in less Request) abound much with these
shining Spots: Nor are the Ancients, (I instance in
<i>Ovid</i>) wholly free from them. I can't help here
observing, what an inexhaustible Fund of Conceits
our modern Poets are supplied with from the Eyes of
the Fair Sex; which, as they are the fruitful Parents of
various Mischiefs, so are they, likewise, it seems, of spurious Wit.</p>

<p class="indent">There is another Species of Thought which
does not, like the former, deviate from Truth and right
Reason, yet is a Violation of the Laws of Beauty
and Accuracy, and is an Instance of false Wit, tho'
not of false Conception. In the <i>Troas</i> of <i>Seneca</i>,
<i>Hecuba</i> lamenting that the Body of <i>Priamus</i> should lie
unburied, thus expresses her Grief:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;<i>Ille, tot regum parens,</i></span>

</div></div>

<p>How poor a Thought, upon so great and sublime a
Subject? How childish a Reflection, that while
<i>Troy</i> was all in Flames, the Body of <i>Priamus</i> should
want Funeral ones? How much better does <i>Virgil</i>
describe the very same Circumstance?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Expos'd; the Head from off the Shoulders torn;</span>
<span class="i0">A Trunk dishonour'd, and without a Name.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Here every Thing is great, full of Majesty, and suitable
to the Subject. The Poet knew better than to
sport with Conceits upon so solemn an Occasion;
tho' <i>Ovid</i> is perpetually hunting after them: But this
is never <i>Virgil</i>'s Fault; and ought to have been as
studiously avoided by <i>Seneca</i>: For Tragedy is of as
sublime a Nature as Epic.</p>

<p class="indent">That celebrated Passage of <i>Lucan</i>, at first Appearance,
I confess, sounds great:

<p>The Assertion is true, but the Wit is <i>false</i>. It is
applied to the Soldiers that died in the Field, and lay
unburied: And tho' we should grant that the Heavens
and the Stars were Materials of greater Value
than Brass and Marble; yet they are a kind of Monument,
that, like Death itself, is common to all;
and, in spite of this <i>Stoical</i> Maxim of the Poet, all
Mankind must think it more honourable to be laid
at Rest in a Grave, than expos'd to Birds and Beasts,
who at last may boast of the same Canopy of the
Sky, that these unburied Heroes enjoy'd.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes it happens, that there is a Mixture
of true Thought and false; or the Conception is partly
one, partly the other. Thus in that noted Epigram by a Modern:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
<i>Lumine Acon dextro, capta est Leonilla sinistro;</i></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Et potis est forma vincere uterque Deos.</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Blande Puer, lumen quod habes concede sorori;</i></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Sic Tu cæcus Amor, sic erit Illa Venus.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Strephon</i> and <i>Phyllis</i> each one Eye have lost,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet may of Beauty more than Mortal boast.</span>
<span class="i0">Let his bright Orb to her the Boy resign,</span>
<span class="i0">He would a <i>Cupid</i>, she a <i>Venus</i> shine.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The Epigram <i>seems</i> elegant, and <i>is</i> really so; but
the different Parts of it are not perfectly reconcileable.
For if <i>Strephon</i> and <i>Phyllis</i> exceeded the Gods in
Beauty, what great Wonder is it, he should become
<i>Cupid</i>, she <i>Venus</i>? Besides, 'tis absurd to suppose
that he should be either willing, or able to transfer
his Eye to his Sister. There is, however, in these
Lines a true epigrammatic Spirit; and nothing can
have more of it than the last of them. For as in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Reasoning a true Conclusion may be drawn from
false Premises; so in Writing an elegant Thought
may flow from false Wit. I would not have it objected,
that I here draw a Comparison between
Things that are no way allied; for all Beauty, not
only in the argumentative Way of Writing, but even
in polite Literature, depends upon the Rules of Logic,
and strict Reasoning.</p>

<p class="indent">The Passages I have here produced are a
few Instances of false Eloquence. Wit, therefore, differs
from a plain solid Thought, as a polish'd Diamond
from a rough one; and as that does not cease to be a
Diamond by being polish'd, so a Thought loses nothing
of its Solidity by its Elegance. We all know,
that a Diamond is not less distinguish'd from other
Stones by its Solidity, than its Lustre: The Difference,
therefore, between true and false Wit, is much
the same as between the Gems of the East, and those
of our <i>British</i> Rocks.</p>

<p class="indent">Some Verses I have known (but not by what
Means) that owe all their Success to popular Applause,
and ill-grounded Fame, instead of Merit. No
one can be a Stranger to the celebrated Epigram of
<i>Sanazarius</i> upon the City of <i>Venice</i>; and who shall
now dare to question its Title to Fame, after so long
a Prescription?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>I submit with humble Deference to the Judgment
of the Learned; but, if I may freely speak my Sentiments,
I have often wonder'd at the good Fortune
of <i>Sanazarius</i>, who, by six empty Verses, got not
only so great a Name, but (which is more substantial)
so great a Sum of Money. The Verses, indeed,
are smooth and harmonious; they have the
outward Appearance of an Epigram, and contain a
poetical Fiction of <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Neptune</i>: But take
away these (and these, without somewhat else, signify
little) what else, in the Name of Elegance, does
the Poet tell us, but that <i>Venice</i> is preferable to
<i>Rome</i>? In naked and simple Terms he says, that the
former looks more like the Work of the Gods, than
the latter. Where is the <i>Acumen</i>, the Wit, or the
Turn? The Shell, indeed, of an Epigram, we see;
but not so much as the Shadow of Wit.</p>

<p class="indent">The first, and principal Species of Wit, is, undoubtedly,
that which does not depend on poetical
Fiction, but upon Truth itself. What the <i>French</i>
Poet<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
says upon this Head, in the Preface to his
Works, is very just; and I think I cannot do better
than give you his Sentiments in an <i>English</i> Dress.
"Now, if any Man asks me, says he, what this
Agreeableness and this Salt is? I answer, That it
is a <i>Je ne sçay quoy</i>, that may be better conceiv'd
than describ'd. But yet, in my Opinion, it principally
consists in offering nothing to the Reader
but true Thoughts, and just Expressions. The
Mind of Man is naturally full of an infinite Number
of confus'd Ideas of <i>Truth</i>, which he often-times
perceives but by Halves; and nothing pleases
him more, than when any of these Ideas are
presented to him well illustrated, and set in a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Light. What is a new brillant, extraordinary
Thought? It is not, as the Ignorant persuade
themselves, a Thought which no Body ever had,
nor ought to have. But, on the contrary, a
Thought which every Body ought to have had,
and which some one bethinks himself of expressing
first. <i>Wit</i> is not <i>Wit</i>, but as it says something
every Body thought of, and that in a lively, delicate,
and new Manner. Let us consider, for Example,
the famous Reply of <i>Lewis</i> XII. to some
of his Ministers, who advised him to punish several
Persons that in the former Reign (when he
was only Duke of <i>Orleans</i>) had made it their Business
to prejudice him, <i>A King of</i> France, <i>says
he, revenges not the Injuries done to a Duke of</i> Orleans.
How comes this Saying to strike us so
suddenly? Is it not plainly, because it presents to
our Eyes a Truth which all the World is sensible
of, and which expresses better than all the finest
Discourses of Morality, <i>That a great Prince, after
his Accession to the Throne, ought no longer to act
by private Movements, nor to have any other View
but the Glory and general Good of his Kingdom?</i>"
Thus far that celebrated Author, who seems very
happily to have illustrated the Subject we are upon.</p>

<p class="indent">We have many elegant Thoughts, likewise,
founded upon Truth, with a Mixture of poetical Fiction;
as in that Epigram of <i>Martial</i> address'd to <i>Lucifer</i>,
the Night before <i>Cæsar</i>'s Return to <i>Rome</i>:
After the first Invocation,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2"><i>Cæsare venturo, Phosphore, redde diem.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou bright Forerunner of the golden Day,</span>
<span class="i0">When <i>Cæsar</i> comes, what clogs thy rosy Way?</span>
</div></div>

<p>At some Distance he adds:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Quid cupidum Titana tenes? jam Xanthus &amp; Æthon</i></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Fræna volunt; vigilat Memnonis alma Parens.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why hold'st thou <i>Ph&oelig;bus</i>, lab'ring to be freed?<span class="linenum">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">His fiery Coursers arm themselves for Speed,<span class="linenum">}</span></span>
<span class="i0">And fair <i>Aurora</i> quits her dewy Bed.<span class="linenum">}</span></span>
</div></div>

<p>He then subjoins:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Tarda tamen nitidæ non cedunt sidera luci;</i></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Et cupit Ausonium Luna videre Ducem.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But scarce the lagging Stars desert the Skies,</span>
<span class="i0">And pensive <i>Cynthia</i> for the Triumph sighs.</span>
</div></div>

<p>'Tis an undoubted Truth, that Time seems long to
those that are big with Expectation. The Poet,
therefore, having, for this Reason, chid the Tardiness
of the Moon and Stars, nothing could be more elegant,
than from this very Circumstance to take a
further Occasion of complimenting the Prince, by
finding out another Reason of their Delay; <i>viz.</i>
that those bright Attendants (for the Poet suppos'd
them endow'd with Sense) stay'd the longer, that they
might be the happy Spectators of <i>Cæsar</i>'s triumphal
Entry. He then gives a new Turn to his Reflections,
and thus concludes the Epigram:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Jam, Cæsar, vel nocte veni; stent astra licebit,</i></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Non deerit populo, Te veniente, dies.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet let not <i>Cæsar</i> wait the rising Morn,</span>
<span class="i0">Or damp our Blessings till the Day's Return:</span>
<span class="i0">His Light shall cheer us with as bright a Ray,</span>
<span class="i0">And without <i>Ph&oelig;bus</i> usher in the Day.</span>
</div></div>

<p>This is ingenious enough, but a little of the boldest.
The Prince of Lyric Poets is more modest upon the
same Occasion:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>He does not say the Approach of <i>Cæsar</i> would restore
the Day, but only increase it; that is, would
add to its Gaiety and Lustre: And true it is, that
Men whose Breasts are fill'd with Joy, think every
Thing about them partakes of that Quality.</p>

<p class="indent">There are other Thoughts, which tho' founded
more upon poetical Fiction than the former, yet
come into the Number of true and elegant ones.
Thus our foremention'd <i>Martial</i>, in his Epitaph upon
<i>Canace</i>, after having beautifully describ'd the Disease
of which the Lady died, in the following Verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>These Kinds of Fictions, tho' very numerous, are no
ways repugnant to Reason, and have not only a
Claim to our Pardon, but to our Praise and Imitation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>Ninth Lecture.</i></b></div>

<p class="indent">In these, and the like Instances,
the great Care is, to have Truth for the Foundation
of what we afterwards advance. As we
see it is in the Example produced from <i>Martial</i>. We
are allow'd in strictest Reason to describe others Merit,
or our own Grief, in Terms a little heighten'd:
If the Lady, then, whose Death the Poet laments,
had, in reality, a soft and melting Voice, he might
justly say it was persuasive enough to have restrained
the Hand of Fate, could it but have found an Utterance:
But Death, fearful of its Power, had seiz'd
that Passage, and cut off the Force of Eloquence.
Thus far a Poet may be allow'd to proceed; but, in
good Truth, very little farther. He treads here, as
it were, upon a Precipice; and this Expression of
<i>Martial</i>, is, perhaps, the utmost Bound of poetic
Truth; the next may carry him into the Ocean
of false Thought. However, this is certain, that all
these ingenious Devices must be built upon something
that has an Existence in Nature, and that it is
absurd to make Fiction the Basis, and the Superstructure
too; as they do, more especially, who from
the Heathen Mythology supply us with Fable in great
abundance. The antiquated Stories of the Heathen
Gods ought to afford Matter only for Comparison
and Allusion, and even then ought to be brought in
with Caution, and to be mention'd only as Beings
once suppos'd to have an Existence. In short, even
the lightest Excursions of Wit ought to be founded
upon Reality; and those empty Trifles are justly
contemn'd, which are neither Panegyric nor Satire,
neither illustrate nor explain any Thing, but the wonderful
Acuteness of the Writer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Tho' a beautiful Composition of Thought and
Words is the greatest Master-piece of Nature, yet
'tis possible for an Oration, or Poem, to be too full
of them, tho' never so much diversified. Whatever
Subject, therefore, you endeavour to adorn, let not
your Poem be loaded with Wit. Jewels have always
been in Esteem, and ever will be so; yet to see a
Garment disfigur'd all over with different Sorts of
them, would be matter of Ridicule, rather than Admiration;
and the most elegant Epicure would be
but little pleas'd with an Entertainment that consisted
of nothing else but Dainties. The same Rule
is not less applicable to Poetry, than Prose; the Reason
of it holds equally in both. Poetry, indeed,
admits of greater Ornament, but right Reason always
abhors Luxury, whether in Prose or Verse. The too
great Plenty of whatever is exquisite, does not gratify,
so much as satiate both the Senses and the Understanding;
and what in itself is valuable, by Super-abundance
becomes ridiculous. By this faulty kind
of Writing the Mind is depriv'd of that Refreshment
and Recreation it takes in passing to and fro
from Things that are excellent, to those that are less
so; and of that Delight which springs from Surprize;
neither of which it is capable of, where all
Things appear with undistinguish'd Lustre. 'Tis a
foolish Ambition, therefore, to work up all the beautiful
Thought and Diction you can possibly croud
together. We ought always, indeed, to avoid in both
whatever is mean or vulgar, and, as <i>Longinus</i><a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
says, is <i>below the Dignity of the Subject</i>; to be always, I
say, above the Populace, tho' sometimes plain, and
without Ornament. It is impossible for a Writer,
from the Nature of his Subject, to be upon the Sublime
from one End to the other: Some Things must
occur, that require the common Style, but if they did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
not, the Rule ought still to be observ'd, for the
Reasons I have before alledg'd. Let Authors take
Example from Nature, who diversifies the great
Poem of the World with Spring and Summer. In
each Season, 'tis true, all Things appear pleasant;
but how much less would they be so, nay, how distasteful,
if the Fields were cover'd with nothing else
but Flowers? Vivid and smiling they are throughout,
but not all over beset with Nosegays. Flowers
grow in their proper and peculiar Soil; so the Ornaments
of a Poem should seem naturally to arise
out of the Matter of it, not forced by Labour, but
promoted only by proper Culture. We ought, indeed,
to imitate Art, and it is no mean Specimen of
it, when we intermix these Beauties so skilfully, that
they mutually correspond, and set off each other;
in the same Manner that the Florist disposes his party-colour'd
Beds, and the Nymph her odorous Garlands.</p>

Beauty in Writing may be consider'd as twofold:
Either the <i>Elegant</i>, or <i>Sublime</i>. The latter is
manifestly distinct from the former; for there may be
Elegance often, where there is no Sublimity; but it
may be question'd, on the other Hand, whether
every Thing <i>sublime</i> is not <i>elegant</i>. To me, indeed,
it seems not so; or, if we must determine
otherwise, it must be said, that Elegance join'd with
Sublimity is often a different Species of Elegance.
Whatever, indeed, is <i>sublime</i>, is <i>beautiful</i>. So
<i>Pallas</i> is describ'd by the Poets, but with a Beauty peculiar
to herself, awful, majestic, surrounded with an amiable
Grandeur, quite different from the Charms of
<i>Venus</i>, who is possess'd with all the soft Attractives,
who is all over elegant, but very little sublime. But
however this Question be determined, in the Sequel
of this Discourse I shall examine into the Properties
of each of these Beauties distinctly, and afterwards
join'd together.</p>

<p>This is one Species of poetic <i>Pathos</i>, or Enthusiasm;
<i>viz.</i> which consists in the Marvellous, and
raises Admiration, by impressing upon the Mind
something great, unusual, and portentous, and is styled
by the <i>Greeks</i> ὁρμη, by the <i>Latins</i>
<i>Impetus</i>, or <i>furor poeticus</i>. There are other
Kinds of it, which excite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Grief, Pity, Terror, and work upon the other Passions.
If the <i>Spirit</i> of the Poet is most admir'd in
the former, the Reader's is at least as much affected
by the latter. And since it is the great Art of Poetry
to work upon the Passions, it may not be improper
to dwell a little upon this Branch of it. How sweet
is that Complaint of <i>Phyllis</i> to <i>Demophoon</i>, in
<i>Ovid</i>? How wonderfully adapted to move Compassion?</p>

<p>After this, the Poet wonderfully describes the dubious
Strife between Love and Shame, Reason and
Affection, as he does in many other Places. I
know, very well, that Objections have been rais'd
against this very Passage I have cited, and that <i>Ovid</i> is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
compar'd with <i>Apollonius Rhodius</i> and <i>Virgil</i>, even
upon these Topics, much to his Disadvantage. I
can't deny but that when he does best, he often falls
short of that Sublimity in which he was naturally
deficient; that when he shines most, he generally
abounds with an unhappy Luxuriancy of Thought,
disagreeable Repetitions, unseasonable and absurd
Conceits; that his Style is loose and incorrect: However,
let him have his due Praise, let him be allow'd
to draw the Out-lines of Nature truly, tho' he does
not keep accurately to every Feature of her.</p>

<p class="indent">But if you want Perfection upon this Head,
consult <i>Virgil</i>, who, as he excels in all other Kinds of
Writing, so, especially, in describing and moving the
Passions, in the fourth <i>Æneis</i> especially; which may
with Justice be styled an <i>Epic Tragedy</i>. And since
no Age, Nation, or Language, has yet produced a
Work that lays open so wonderfully the various Tumults
of the Soul; I shall perform, perhaps, no disagreeable
Office, if I lay before you an Epitome of
this Part of it, so far as relates to the Passions.</p>

I cannot assent to. Ὁϛ δ' ἑτερου τι ἡ ῥητορικη φαντασια βουλεται,
και ἑτερον ἡ παρα ποιηταιϛ, ουκ αν λαθοι σε. Ουδ' ὁτι τηϛ μεν εν ποιησει
τελοϛ εστιν εκπληξιϛ, τηϛ δ' εν λογοιϛ εναργεια
Which <i>Tollius</i> thus paraphrastically translates: "You cannot
be ignorant, I suppose, that Oratorical Visions intend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
one Thing, and Poetical another; that the Aim
of the latter is to affect the Hearers with
Terror; of the former to express every Thing
so strongly, that it may be rather seen, than
heard by the Audience. The one we may properly
call Evidence, or Illustration; the other
Consternation, or Amazement." I own, I say,
this is what I cannot well digest; for neither is it true
that the Images, which Poetry impresses, affect us
with Terror only, for all Sorts of Images are impress'd
by Poetry; nor is it the peculiar Property of
Oratory <i>to express every Thing so strongly, that it may
be rather seen, than heard by the Audience</i>; since
Poetry has a much larger Share in this Province than
Oratory. The only Difference between them in this
Particular is, that all Images are impress'd more
<i>strongly</i> by the one; but all are <i>truly</i> impress'd by
both. This is a Difficulty in <i>Longinus</i>, which not
one of his numerous Commentators has touch'd upon.
If, therefore, I am fallen into any Mistake, I hope I
shall be the easier pardoned, as I have none of the
Helps of the Learned to conduct me out of it.
But however that be, all are agreed that the Images
excited, both by Oratory and Poetry, strike the Mind
with a sudden Force. To prove this, <i>Longinus</i> recites
the Speech of <i>Orestes</i><a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>,
where he cries out, that he sees his Mother and the Furies
stand before him; which <i>Virgil</i> has wonderfully imitated,
in the following Passage:</p>

<p>As I have occasionally mention'd this remarkable
Place, it may not be amiss to observe, that Images
are no where better impress'd, than throughout that
Description, where <i>Dido</i> is represented under the
Conflicts of Love, and dismay'd with Prodigies. I
shall only cite one Part of it, and the rather, because
it contains a mere intellectual Idea not subject to
the Senses, which yet is as clearly impress'd, as if it
were the proper Object of them: An infallible Proof
of the Skill of the Painter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Tenth Lecture.</i></div>

<p class="indent">It would be entering upon too large a
Field, to enquire into all the Variations,
and Turns of Thought and Style, which
Verse and Prose are capable of: Such as, Interrogations,
Exclamations, the different Disposition of
Tropes and Figures, the elegant Repetition of
Words, the no less elegant Abruptness in Sentences,
the Want of Connexion, Apostrophe, Prosopop&oelig;ia,
the Change of Numbers, Persons, Cases, Tenses;
and a Multitude of other Incidents, which are reducible
to Thought, as well as Style. Since the Variety
of these is as infinite, as their Elegance is exquisite, it
is impossible to explain them all by Rules, or illustrate
them by Example. <i>Longinus</i> has mentioned
some few, and our modern Books of Rhetoric are
full of them. But the Want of Precept will be abundantly
compensated to the Learner, by a good
Taste, and a diligent Application to the Study of the best Authors.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the many Embellishments of Writing,
few are attended with greater Beauty than <i>Antitheta</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
The Reason is obvious, because Contraries illustrate,
and recommend each other by Comparison. Of
this the following Passage in <i>Virgil</i> is a remarkable
Instance; where we have a beautiful Irony and Antithesis,
at the same Time:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<i>Egregiam vero laudem, &amp; spolia ampla refertis,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tuque, puerque tuus, magnum &amp; memorabile nomen;</i></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Prodigious Trophies you indeed have gain'd,</span>
<span class="i0">You, and your Boy; vast Praise, a deathless Name;</span>
<span class="i0">If by the Fraud of two celestial Pow'rs</span>
<span class="i0">One Woman be subdu'd.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Near a-kin to it, is that Antithesis in <i>Ovid</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i9"><a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Will you, my Friends, united Strength employ,</span>
<span class="i0">Against one many, Men against a Boy?</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">When the Thoughts are thus set against each other,
they appear with Energy, and strike the Mind with
redoubled Force.</p>

<p class="indent">Another Elegance in a Writer, is to convey the
whole of his Idea to the Reader, by expressing only
some Circumstances of it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
<i>Dixerat; atque illam media inter talia ferro</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Collapsam aspiciunt comites, ensemque cruore</i></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus, while she spoke, th' Attendants saw her fall,</span>
<span class="i0">The Sword all frothing, and her Hands besmear'd</span>
<span class="i0">With Blood.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus <i>Virgil</i> describes <i>Dido</i> killing herself: An
inferior Poet, no doubt, would have represented her in
the fatal Act, rushing upon the Sword with all her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Strength, the Blood gushing out, and that Part of her
Body which receiv'd the Wound expos'd to View.
But how much better are all these passed over, and
suggested to us only by their Adjuncts and Effects?
There is another Example, of this kind, in the fourth
<i>Georgic</i>, which is truly wonderful:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>At chorus æqualis Dryadum clamore supremos</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Implerunt montes; flerunt Rhodopeiæ arces</i>, &amp;c.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She doom'd to Death, while, heedless, thee she fled,</span>
<span class="i0">Along the River's Side, before her Steps,</span>
<span class="i0">In the high Grass saw not the monstrous Snake,</span>
<span class="i0">Which, unperceiv'd, lay lurking on the Bank.</span>
<span class="i0">But all the beauteous Quire of Woodland Nymphs,</span>
<span class="i0">Her Fellows, fill'd with Shrieks the lofty Hills;</span>
<span class="i0">The <i>Rhodopeian</i> Mountains wept, <i>&amp;c.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>How concise, and ingenious! This Artifice of insinuating
only the Sense to the Reader, is so useful in
Epigram, that the whole Thought often turns upon
it. Thus in that of <i>Martial</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
<i>Pexatus pulchre, rides mea, Zoile, trita;</i></span>
<span class="i5"><i>Sunt hæc trita quidem, Zoile; sed mea sunt.</i></span>

<span class="i0">My Threadbare Coat is scorn'd by Liv'ry-<i>John</i>:</span>
<span class="i0">'Tis true, 'tis Threadbare&mdash;but it is my own.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The Turn, you see, is witty, and facetious! But how
poor a Joke had it been, if the Poet had only said,
however true it was, that the Clothes which <i>Zoilus</i>
wore were not his own? But I fear, I transgress the
very Rule I am recommending: I shall therefore add
no more, than only to remind the Reader, that what
I have said under another Head<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
might more properly come under this, <i>viz. That the Mind of Man does
not love to have too minute a Detail of Particulars;
but takes a Pleasure in having Room for Imagination,
and in forming a Judgment of what is not express'd,
from what is.</i></p>

<p class="indent">And since I have casually mention'd Transitions,
I would here observe, that the Elegance of them is
equal to their Difficulty: The great Secret consists either
in digressing of a <i>sudden</i> to some new Subject,
and giving the Reader the Pleasure of a Surprize;
and yet continuing on the Thread of the Discourse
so artfully, that he may admire a <i>Connection</i>, where,
at first, there seem'd to be none: Or in such a gradual
Transition from Thought to Thought, of near Affinity
with each other, that the Mind may be imperceptibly
led to a very different Subject, without being
sensible of the intermediate Steps of the Digression.
Thus, in the Rainbow, the neighbouring Colours
are so like each other, that 'tis hard to say where this
ends, or that begins; yet there's a wide Difference,
if we leave out the intermediate Shades, and compare
the Rays of the two Extremes. My Meaning,
perhaps, will appear clearer from Example. <i>Horace</i>
begins his 29th Ode, of the third Book, in the following Manner:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Tyrrhena regum progenies, tibi</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Non ante verso lene merum cado,</i></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Cum flore, Mæcenas, rosarum,</i></span>
<span class="i4"><i>Pressa tuis balanus capillis</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Jamdudum apud me est,</i> &amp;c.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">My noble Lord, of Royal Blood,</span>

<span class="i2">My Roses pluck'd to grace thy Head;</span>
<span class="i0">As fair and sweet as e'er <i>Præneste</i> bore.</span>

<p>And concludes it thus:

<span class="i44"><i>Creech.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Between the Beginning and Ending, consider'd
in themselves, how wide a Difference? And yet, if we
examine the Gradation of Thought thro' the whole
Ode, we shall see the most elegant Connection. In
the Beginning, the Poet invites his Statesman Friend
to Supper: "I have prepared every Thing for your
Reception, says he; leave, for a While, the City,
the Business and Riches of it; 'tis a Pleasure often
to Men of high Station, to partake of the Change
of Low Life. Forget Politics for a While, and
be not over anxious for the Nation's Welfare.
Providence conceals Futurity from us Mortals:
Let us therefore, in Prudence, make the best
of the present; all else is carry'd down by the
Stream of Time, and what is past returns no more.
Fortune is fickle; I am pleas'd, when she smiles;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
but disregard her Frowns, contented with Poverty
and Virtue. Care is the inseparable Attendant
of Riches; I compound to want the one,
that I may be secure from the other. I have no
Business, when Storms roar, to fall into Tears,"
<i>&amp;c</i>. Behold a Chain connected, and yet conceal'd
with the greatest Art.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes it is necessary that the Transition
should appear open, and design'd; but often otherwise.
In the following Passage, we shall see a Specimen
of either Sort; I mean, of the formal, and of
the sudden Transition. <i>Turnus</i> having, in the eleventh
<i>Æneis</i>, had a good many Words with <i>Drances</i>,
and in great Passion thrown out these, among the rest,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>thus turns his Discourse to the King:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Nunc ad Te, &amp; tua, magne Pater, consulta revertor.</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Si nullam nostris ultra spem ponis in armis,</i></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To you, great Monarch, and to your Debates,</span>
<span class="i0">I now return. If you no more repose</span>
<span class="i0">Hope in our Arms; if by one Battle lost,</span>
<span class="i0">We perish whole, and Fortune knows no Change;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Let us beg Peace, and stretch our Hands unarm'd.</span>
<span class="i0">(Yet Oh! did any of our pristine Worth</span>
<span class="i0">And Virtue still remain; that Man to me</span>

<span class="i0">Who, rather than behold a Thing like this,</span>
<span class="i0">Fell once for all, and dying bit the Ground.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Reverence due to Majesty requir'd that <i>Turnus</i>
should direct his Discourse from <i>Drances</i> to the King,
by some solemn Address. But after <i>dextras tendamus
inermes</i>, to <i>Quanquam ô! si solitæ quicquam virtutis
adesset</i>, the Transition is sudden, and unexpected.
The Mind, by this Means, is transported
from one Contrary to another; a sure Indication of
the Force of Eloquence, and of its powerful Operation
on its Hearers.</p>

<p class="indent">In Narrations 'tis no small Art to make a Transition
from one Fact to another: Several Instances
of this, we have in <i>Ovid</i>'s <i>Metamorphoses</i>,
the Nature of which Work requir'd them; where the Connection,
indeed, is sometimes neat and artful, sometimes
hard and forced, not to say ridiculous.</p>

<p class="indent">Under this Head we may reckon those Excursions
of another kind, in which the Poet, by some sudden
Allusion or Comparison, diverts from his Subject to
a new Matter, and immediately returns to it again.
I shall explain myself better by Example. <i>Juvenal</i>,
describing the various Inconveniencies of the City,

<p>These Excursions are chiefly suitable to <i>Satire</i>; and
there's no Branch of it attended with greater Wit
and Poignancy.</p>

<p class="indent">I have not Room here, to treat of <i>Comparisons</i>
in the Manner they deserve; they being so various, that
they would require an entire Dissertation. When
they are ill drawn, nothing is more ridiculous;
when well, nothing more beautiful. No kind of
Style is excluded from them, and they are not only
an Ornament, but often an Illustration of the Subject.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
They ought always to appear natural, never
forced, or far fetch'd. Avoid, therefore, the Fault
of those Writers, who find out what they call <i>Similies</i>
first, and afterwards Matter to apply to them.
Not that they are guilty of it, whose Comparisons
don't in every Respect coincide with what they were
brought to illustrate. Even the most elegant of
them agree sometimes with the Description but in
one Adjunct. Thus <i>Virgil</i>, in the eighth <i>Æneis</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Upon a nice Scrutiny, the Parallel between Love
and Thunder will hold but very little: And yet no
good Judge, I believe, will dispute the Elegance of
the above Comparison.</p>

<p class="indent">On this Head our Moderns seem to excel
the Ancients, and to have found out an Use of Comparisons
which they were utter Strangers to. Theirs
are merely ornamental; ours often contain the
Points of Epigram, the Jibes of Satire, and the Banters
of Comedy; an Art which <i>Ovid</i>, <i>Martial</i>, <i>Juvenal</i>,
<i>Horace</i> and <i>Terence</i> knew very little of. It
will not be allow'd me to produce Instances here;
but innumerable I could produce, if a Mixture of
different Languages, and especially of our own,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
would not sound disagreeable in these <i>Latin</i>
Dissertations<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>.
'Tis true, Tragic and Epic Poets ought
totally to avoid these witty Allusions; which are below
the Severity of their Style, and the Dignity of
their Compositions. The Comparisons that serve
for Illustration only, come within their Province;
such as we meet with very frequently in <i>Homer</i> and
<i>Virgil</i>: Tho' (to say the Truth) even the best Writers
among the Ancients seem on this Head to labour
under a Poverty of Matter. In the Description of
a Battle, for Instance, the Similes of a Lion, a Bull,
a Serpent, an Eagle, and other Animals of the fiercer
kind, recur too frequently under some small Variations.
But in After-Ages the Increase of Arts, and
Sciences, and of Religion more particularly, open'd
a new Field, which has minister'd abundantly not
only to the Emolument of Mankind in general, but
in this, and in all other Respects, to the Refinement of Wit.</p>

<p class="indent">If I must give my Opinion of those <i>luxurious
Comparisons</i> that deviate from the Subject, which
<i>Homer</i>, chiefly, among the Ancients, and <i>Milton</i>,
among the Moderns, run into; I must confess, they
neither deserve Commendation, nor are capable of
Defence. But as they have the Sanction of so great
Authority, it is not for me to pass Judgment on
them, but leave every one to follow his own.</p>

<p class="indent">If I remember right, there are few or no
Similes in the Tragedies of the ancient Poets. Among the
Moderns, no kind of Writing abounds more with
them; and it must be own'd, they are often much
to be admir'd: But very different are some of these;
such, in particular, as are introduced uttered by
Persons labouring under the Height of Passion, or in
the Agonies of Death; than which, nothing can be
more absurd, or unpardonable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
As I have casually mention'd this Error in Writing,
I would farther observe, your <i>pretty Thoughts</i>,
as they are commonly call'd, are neither suitable in
a Passion, nor proper to raise one; they only serve
in Descriptions to play upon the Imagination, not to
put the Affections in Motion. A Breast struggling
with Anger, Grief, or Desire, is little sollicitous to
express its Anguish in fine wrought Turns of Wit,
which will never be able to move the Reader to any
Thing else but Madness at the Author's Folly. The
plainer Commotions of the Mind are express'd, the
better; here the chief Elegance is to want Ornament,
and 'tis the great Master-piece of Art to conceal
itself in representing Nature. Some Figures,
indeed, are not only allowable in these Cases, but
necessary; those, in particular, which impress upon
the Mind the various Conflicts of the Soul; for such
are the Language of Persons who feel these Tumults,
tho' they were never taught to express them
by the Rules of Rhetoric. But Metaphors and Antitheses,
and all Decorations of that kind, must be
us'd sparingly, excepting only those Metaphors
which Orators sometimes call forth to express their
Rage, with all the Fire of Eloquence. This I then
rather observe, that I might not seem to contradict
<i>Longinus</i>; who, speaking of a Multitude of Metaphors,
says<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>,
they are then most useful, <i>when the
Passions swell like a Torrent</i>. He produces an Instance
out of <i>Demosthenes</i>, where the Orator indeed
appears in Agitation; but still they are different from
those we are now speaking of, and not so much
the Effect of Nature, as of Art: And even here the
Metaphors are far from being bold, nor much distorted
from their literal Sense. 'Tis certain, <i>Longinus</i>
did not propose this as a <i>general</i> Rule; nor is
it possible to represent those Throws and Labours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of the Soul in Oratory, which appear in Tragic and
Epic Characters; where Joy, Grief, and Anger,
glow more intensely, as well as more naturally. But
if the Orator feels the same Emotions, and in the
same Degree, it is certain he must abstain from the
abundant use of Metaphors.</p>

<p class="indent">Before I conclude this Dissertation, I
would lay before my Audience, as clear
an Idea of the different Kinds of Thought
which have not yet been touch'd upon, as Words
can convey, and so nice a Subject will admit of.
The <i>Mordacity</i> of the <i>severe</i> and <i>jocose</i> Satire,
has been already describ'd, and some Examples produc'd of each.</p>

<p class="indent">There are Thoughts, likewise, of the <i>delicate</i>
Kind, whose Excellence does not consist in their
<i>Acuteness</i>, but in an artful and agreeable Turn;
which don't strike the Imagination at once with
Wonder; but move it gently, with a more even
Tenor. In this soft Strain, <i>Phædra</i> begins her Epistle
to her dear <i>Hippolytus</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
<i>Qua, nisi Tu dederis, caritura est ipsa, salutem</i></span>
<span class="i6"><i>Mittit Amazonio Cressa puella viro.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That Health, <i>Hippolytus</i>, from me receive,</span>
<span class="i0">Which to the Writer you alone must give.</span>
</div></div>

<p>I could easily have excused <i>Ovid</i> making use of so
beautiful a Turn twice, if he had kept it without
any Variation. For in his <i>Metamorphoses</i>, <i>Byblis</i>
writes to her Brother almost in the same Terms:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
<i>Quam, nisi Tu dederis, non est habitura, salutem,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hanc tibi mittit amans.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thy Lover, gentle <i>Caunus</i>, wishes thee</span>
<span class="i0">That Health, which thou, alone, canst give to me.</span>
<span class="i33"><i>Steph. Harvey</i>, Esq.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>But here, for want of the Word <i>ipsa</i>, the Elegance
is quite lost, and the Emphasis spoil'd. In the same
Poet, <i>Helen</i>, under a Pretence of dissuading <i>Paris</i>
from persevering in his Addresses to her, pays a
Compliment to his Beauty, and shews the just Sense
she has of her own; and, at the same Time, artfully
insinuates, that she has no Aversion to his Love, but
rather a secret Passion for him: And expresses all
this with wonderful Address, in one Verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">From my Example learn,</span>

</div></div>

<p>Nothing can be more ingenious. This single Line
so teems with Thought, that it would bear, nay require
a long Examination, to discover all its Beauties.
At every Word some new Idea arises, which I
shall, at present, leave to the Reflection of others,
that I may not anticipate so great a Pleasure. Under
this Head of <i>delicate Thought</i>, we may reckon that
celebrated Compliment with which <i>Horace</i> begins
his Epistle to <i>Augustus</i>:</p>

<p>The Address is as genteel as it is ingenious, and it is

hard to say whether we should admire in it more the
Poet, or the Courtier.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Strong Thoughts</i> are such as strike us neither with
<i>Acuteness</i>, their <i>Suddenness</i>, nor their <i>Delicacy</i>;
but are full of Sense and Solidity, carry Weight in their Meaning,
and sink deep in the Understanding. As in that of <i>Virgil</i>:</p>

<p>For it is a great Mistake to think, that Gravity and
Severity in Writing is inconsistent with Wit and Ingenuity.
There's Elegance in moral and philosophical
Reflections; and nothing can have more of it
than those Sentences that are scatter'd up and down
in the Narrations, but especially the Speeches, in
<i>Virgil</i>. In the eleventh <i>Æneis</i>, the confederate
<i>Latin</i> Princes deliberate in Council what Steps to take
after their late Defeat; <i>Turnus</i>, in a Speech upon
that Occasion, observes, that since they had Forces
enough left to continue the War, they were not reduced
to the sad Necessity of suing for Peace. The
moral Reflection he introduces, will be clearer seen,
by considering the Verses before and after it.</p>

<p>These <i>echoing Turns</i>, much affected by the Moderns,
tho' little us'd by the Ancients, have sometimes their
Beauty, sometimes not: I can by no means agree
with a certain Writer of ours, who tells us, that

instances in that of <i>Orpheus</i> looking back upon <i>Eurydice</i>:</p>

<p>You see what a beautiful Effect this Repetition of
the Words and Thoughts has; and how much Melancholy
it adds to the Complaint. It is obvious
from hence to observe, that <i>Virgil</i> could have far
excell'd <i>Ovid</i> in these lighter Conceits, if he had not
chose to let his Genius soar to much higher Flights.
Under this Head we may add the following Passage from <i>Ovid</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>The Elegance of these Lines consists in giving a new
Sense to the same Words; they reverberate, as it
were, the Motions of the Mind, and by that Means
affect it with Surprize and Admiration. But there
are many who love to be sporting thus with Words,
that are even without Meaning, and have no
Thought in them to be reflected. They are a sort
of <i>nominal</i> Turns, that our Youth are wonderfully
studious of, especially in their Prose Writings, and
which conduce not a little to the Corruption of their Taste.</p>

<p class="indent">There are Thoughts, likewise, of near Affinity
with these, that consist in <i>Contraries</i>, and are sometimes
beautiful, often ridiculous. Of the beautiful
Kind, is that of <i>Martial</i> to <i>Cæsar</i>:

<span class="i6"><i>Culpa tua est; quamvis hoc quoque culpa tua est.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the former Instance, there's only a <i>seeming Contrariety</i>,
which is built upon solid Truth; the latter
approaches too near a Contradiction, I fear, indeed,
it is one. To many of these elegant Fancies (among
the Admirers of which Crowds of our modern Writers
are desirous of being number'd) that Sneer of
<i>Martial</i> may with much Justice be applied:</p>

new Species of Wit is) are in Reality what they seem:
Or, if they deserve any better Name, they are an
empty Sound of Words, <i>meer Noise, and Nonsense</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Tho' the greatest Part of modern Wit turns entirely
on this playing upon Words, I don't mean in
Conversation only, (where these Trifles are hardly,
very hardly tolerable) but even in the severest Writings,
yet every Man of common Sense is so convinced
of the Absurdity of prostituting it to the
Abuse of Words, that I shall dwell no longer upon
so disagreeable, so contemptible a Subject. I would

<p>And it can't be denied but <i>Terence</i>, and some of the
best Writers, have some little Touches of this Epidemical
Distemper. There are few of these Conceits
but are <i>merely equivocal</i>, that is, vary as little in
the Thought, as in the Expression; a sort of Collision,
from whence, 'tis possible, some Sparks of Wit
may sometimes, but very rarely, be struck out. Thus
much I thought proper to lay before you, in Relation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
to the <i>Elegance</i> of <i>Thought</i> in Poetry,
both true and false.</p>

<p class="indent">I have little Occasion to enlarge distinctly upon
the <i>Sublime</i>, because many Things relating to it
fell in with what I have before advanced. However, as
this was one of the Topics I propos'd to treat of, it
is necessary I should say somewhat to it, before I
conclude this Dissertation. I cannot better explain
to you the Nature of the <i>Sublime</i>, and the Manner
of its affecting us, than by giving you the Sense of
<i>Longinus</i><a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
upon it, not in a literal Version, but by
representing the Substance of him in a few Words.
Whence is it that Writers of this Class, in a divine
Impetuosity seem regardless of Accuracy, and scorn
to be confin'd within the vulgar Rules of Exactness?
The Truth is, Nature has form'd Man of an inquisitive
Genius, and plac'd him in the World to behold
and admire the Wonders of it; not as an idle
Spectator, but as one concern'd in its busiest Scenes,
eager for Action, and panting after Glory. To this
End, he is strongly actuated by a Love and Desire
of every Thing that is great and divine. The vast
Expanse of the Universe cannot bound his Imagination;
he extends his Thoughts into other Worlds,
and is lost only in Infinity.</p>

<p>And, in Truth, if we contemplate a Hero, whose
Life is one continu'd Series of great Actions, we then
may make some Estimate of what we were born
to. Hence, then, it is, that Fountains and Rivulets,
which answer all the common Conveniencies of
Life, never in a great Degree awaken our Attention.

But when we view the <i>Rhine</i>, the <i>Nile</i>, the <i>Danube</i>,
but, above all, the Ocean, we stand fix'd at once
with Awe and Wonder. So again, without any Emotion,
we behold the daily Fires, of our own making,
how long soever they continue burning: But
we gaze with Astonishment at any sudden Light in
the Heavens, tho' it vanishes, perhaps, as soon as it
appears. Nor is there any Thing more wonderful in
Nature than the Eruptions of Mount <i>Ætna</i>, which
sometimes discharges from its Caverns Stones, and Deluges of Fire:</p>

<span class="i0">And tosses Balls of Flame, and licks the Stars.</span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes with loud Explosion high it hurls</span>
<span class="i0">Vast Rocks, and Entrails from the Mountain torn,</span>
<span class="i0">With roaring Noise slings molten Stones in Air,</span>
<span class="i0">And boils, and bellows, from its lowest Caves.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Upon the whole, we may draw this Conclusion,
that Things of common Use or Necessity, lose all
their Wonder, by their Frequency; but whatever is
unusual, and beyond the Course of Nature, strikes
our Attention, and calls forth our Admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">I before observ'd, and therefore need not insist
upon it farther here, that the opposite to <i>Sublime</i> is
<i>Bombast</i> and <i>Fustian</i>. I observ'd likewise, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
<i>Sublime</i> was not incompatible with the <i>plain</i> Style,
tho' chiefly adapted to the <i>Heroic</i>, and produc'd Examples
of both; for what I said in Relation to Style,
I told you, in the Beginning of this Dissertation, was
<i>sometimes</i> applicable to Thought. I would now add,
that 'tis a great Mistake to think that the <i>Sublime</i> is
only, or chiefly suited to Joy, Triumphs, and pompous
Descriptions; for nothing has more of that
Quality than those Ideas that command <i>Pity</i> and <i>Terror</i>.
I shall produce one, but a very remarkable Instance
of each, taken almost from the same Place.
<i>Turnus</i>, when his Forces were defeated, and his own
Death approaching, dissuades his Sister <i>Juturna</i> from
any farther fruitless Offices of her Love, in this Heroical Complaint:</p>

<h2>LECTURE XII.<br />
<small><i>Of Epigram, and other lighter Species of Poetry.</i></small></h2>
<hr class="r65" />

<p class="indent">Designing to treat of the several Species
of Poetry, I thought proper to begin with the lowest,
and so gradually proceed to others of a higher Kind,
till at last I come to the Epic or Heroic Poem.</p>

<p class="indent">Epigram shall be the chief Subject of
this Discourse. But as there are other small Poems, which
will scarce deserve a distinct one, I shall here make
such Observations upon them as may be necessary.</p>

<p class="indent">The Account we have of Epigram, both
of the Name and Thing, is this: It was usual, it seems,
among the Ancients, to cut short Inscriptions under
the Statues of their Gods, which they call'd
επιγραφαι, and επιγραμματα. These Inscriptions
serv'd as <i>Lemmata</i>, or Subjects for little poetical
Conceits, which were afterwards themselves term'd Epigrams.
That upon the Statue of <i>Venus</i> made by <i>Praxiteles</i>,
is well known.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Γυμνην οιδε Παριϛ με, και Αγκισηϛ, και Αδονιϛ.</span>
<span class="i2">Τουϛ τρρειϛ οιδα μονουϛ, Πραξιτελεϛ δε ποθεν?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And what, said she, does this bold Painter mean?</span>
<span class="i0">When was I bathing thus, and naked seen?</span>
<span class="i33"><i>Prior.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Course of Time, other Poems of like Nature,
whatever their Subject was, went by the Name of
Epigrams, on account of their Affinity with those to
which that Title was first appropriated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Epigrams are divided into various Heads; the
greater, the less, the equal<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>,
the simple, the compound, the digressive, <i>&amp;c.</i>
But so minute a Distinction is needless, since they may be made
upon any Subject. Some are satirical, as that of <i>Martial</i>,</p>

<span class="i0">What mean'st thou, <i>Tucca</i>, with Tocay to join</span>

<span class="i0">Prepost'rous Charity the Cut-throat show?</span>
<span class="i0">To spoil Tocay, however fare your Guest,</span>
<span class="i0">Is Murder, without Benefit of Priest.</span>
<span class="i0">Poison allow the Merit of your Friend;</span>
<span class="i0">But the poor Cask deserv'd a better End.</span>
</div></div>

<p>This, I should think, is the best kind of Epigram;
for if the Nature of it in general consists in being
acute, whatever is satirical, must always be so. Not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
but that there are other proper Subjects of it. Some
panegyrical, directly contrary to the former; many
of which we have in <i>Martial</i> upon the Emperor
<i>Domitian</i>, and in others. That of <i>Virgil</i> is famous.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Nocte pluit tota, redeunt spectacula mane;</i></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Divisum imperium cum Jove Cæsar habet.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Show'rs brought on the Night, the Shews the Day:</span>
<span class="i0">Thus <i>Jove</i> and <i>Cæsar</i> bear an equal Sway.</span>

<p>And the Inscription by a Modern design'd for the
Palace of the late King of <i>France</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Non orbis gentem, non urbem gens habet ullam,</i></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Urbsve domum, dominum nec domus ulla, parem.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The world no Realm, no Realm a City sees,</span>
<span class="i0">No City House, no House a Lord like this.</span>
</div></div>

<p>In which, tho' there is not that witty Turn which is
usually reckon'd essential to Epigram; yet the Climax
is so finely work'd up, that it well deserves the
great Praises that have been given it. There are other
Epigrams of the Love Kind; as the following
one in the Anthology of <i>Italian</i> Poets:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Me lætis Leonilla oculis, me Lydia torvis</i></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Aspicit; hæc noctem nuntiat, illa diem.</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Has Cytherea meo stellas præfecit amori;</i></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Hæc meus est Vesper, Lucifer illa meus.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One with a sleepy, one a smirking Ray,</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fusca</i> the Night foretels, <i>Lucy</i> the Day.</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Venus</i> ordain'd, that each by Turns shou'd move,</span>
<span class="i0">The Morning, and the Ev'ning Star of Love.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Here, indeed, we have the true <i>Form</i> and <i>Shape</i> of
an Epigram, it has all the <i>Appearance</i> of Wit and
Elegance; but I fear it offends against right Reason
and Nature. Some there are, upon various Circumstances
or Events, which are scarce reducible to any

<p>And this <i>Greek</i> Epigram:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Χρυσον ανηρ ἑυρων ελιπε βροχον, αυταρ ὁ χρυσον.</span>
<span class="i2">Ον λιπεν ουχ ἑυρων, ἡψευ ον ἑυρε βροχον.</span>

<span class="i0">Had lost the Gold,&mdash;<i>to one a Blessing, one a Curse</i>.<span class="linenum">}</span></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here, again, the true Spirit of Epigram seems wanting;
we have no Point of Wit, but only a plain
Narration of Fact. But still, the Words are so elegantly
opposed to each other, and in so short a Compass,
that we shall scarce meet with any Thing
which exceeds it. While I am speaking of the different
Subjects of Epigram, I would observe, that
Religion is sometimes one. And as nothing is so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
suitable to Poetry as the <i>Marvellous</i>, nothing can afford
more Matter for it than the <i>Christian</i> Religion,
which so much abounds with Miracles. I shall
shew, perhaps, hereafter, how well adapted it is for
Poems of the highest Kind, when I come to speak
of <i>sacred Poetry</i>; but how proper a Subject it is for
Epigram, is self-evident. For tho' these sort of Verses
are often ludicrous, and trifling; yet they sometimes
breathe a Spirit of Sublimity, every way becoming
them. There are many of <i>Martial</i> of this
Kind. That, for Instance, to the Emperor <i>Domitian</i>, upon
his erecting to himself a triumphal Arch, and a Temple to Fortune:</p>

<p>If it be ask'd in what the Nature of Epigram in general
consists; I reply, Acuteness and Facetiousness
are its chief Characteristicks. It ought not to be
mix'd, but uniform; to tend only to one Point,
which is always to be express'd with Strength and
Poignancy in the last Verse. This is above all to be
regarded: If the last Verse be flat and languid, or
faulty in any Respect, it spoils the whole, how beautiful
soever the several Parts are.</p>

<p class="indent">This, I say, is, in general, the Nature
of Epigrams; to which, however, there are, perhaps, some few
Exceptions, that are not so remarkable for their Acuteness
and Facetiousness, as for their Softness and
Delicacy, or some other Elegance. I have given
Instances of one or two already; whether they are
to be look'd upon as Epigrams, or to be class'd under
some other Species of Poetry, I am little sollicitous.
It is certain, there are some short beautiful
Poems which cannot come within this Denomination;
several in <i>Martial</i>, particularly, and many
which you, Gentlemen, compose for your Lent Exercises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
upon philosophical Subjects; which, as they
have already gain'd you great Reputation, so would
they farther extend it, if a judicious Collection of
them were publish'd<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>.
The greatest Part of these are true Epigrams,
 witty and facetious. Some are Descriptions,
Allusions, or poetical Fictions, elegant
and beautiful, by whatever Name they are
call'd, matters not. No one, I think, could justly
object to you, that you affected a barren Subject
for Poetry, the better to shew the Strength of
your Parts, and Liveliness of your Invention; like a
certain Monarch, who industriously chose a Place
for his stately Fountains, incapable of having Water
brought to it but at a prodigious Expense, only that
he might leave a Monument of the Greatness of his
Power and Magnificence: For as different as Poetry
and Philosophy may seem to be, the one affords
abundant Matter for the other, by furnishing the
Mind with a Variety of Ideas, and diverting it continually
into new Channels.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Elogiums</i> and <i>Inscriptions</i> are to be reduced to this
Head, and <i>Epitaphs</i> likewise; the Elegance of which
chiefly consists in an expressive Brevity. They
should not have so much as one Epithet, properly so
called; nor two Words synonymous. Some of these
are true Metre, others are something between Prose
and Verse, without any set Measure, but the Words
perfectly poetical<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>.
</p>

<p class="indent">These little Compositions are often very beautiful:
And I might add to them <i>Emblems</i>, or <i>Symbols</i>; by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
which I mean certain Figures, painted or cut, metaphorically
expressing some Action, with an imperfect
Sentence at Bottom, which in some measure
explains the Sense of the Device, but leaves the
Reader to supply the rest. The Painting is call'd
the Body of the Emblem, the Sentence at Bottom,
the Soul of it. These are Compositions purely
poetical, and are often full of Thought and Elegance,
I may add, of poetical Action too. A certain
<i>French</i> Writer<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> (and among the <i>French</i> this
Invention is in most Esteem) has writ a long and
accurate Dissertation upon Emblems; wherein he has
precisely defin'd their Nature, explain'd their different
Species, laid down Rules for their Composition,
and for distinguishing the true from the false; and,
lastly, has produc'd Variety of Examples of them. I
shall lay before you one Instance from him, that you
may the better judge both of their Nature and Elegance.
To express the Secresy of the King of
<i>France</i>'s Counsels, as well as the terrible Effects of
them to his Enemies, the Sun was represented behind
a Cloud, with this half Verse at Bottom:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;<i>Tegiturque, parat dum fulmina.</i>&mdash;&mdash;</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Conceal'd while he prepares his Bolts.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">This is an Invention which I take to be
modern, entirely unknown to the Ancients. And tho' the
<i>French</i> Author I just mention'd may (according to
the Genius of his Nation) attribute, perhaps, more
to it than it deserves; yet it certainly deserves its
Praise, for Elegance and Ingenuity.</p>

<p class="indent">But to return to Epigrams: Whatever you
write, <i>be short</i>. Those, perhaps, are the best,
which don't exceed eight Lines; for the rest, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
cannot be too short. This Rule, however, I don't
propose as a general one. Some Epigrams may be
beautiful, tho' longer; one of which I have already
cited in this Discourse.</p>

<p class="indent">As to the Verse; in <i>Latin</i> (for of that
Language I here principally speak) Hexameter and Pentameter
are the most proper, tho' others are not to be excluded;
for Iambics and Hendecasyllables are frequently made use of.</p>

<p class="indent">Many of the Hendecasyllable Poems are
rather Odes than Epigrams: Some seem to be of a mix'd
Nature; and Poetry has nothing more beautiful than
both. <i>Catullus</i> is reckon'd the Prince in this Kind
of Writing, whom others, both Ancients and Moderns,
have very happily imitated, and some, perhaps,
excell'd. The Nature of them consists in being
lax and free, in chusing light Subjects, especially
those of Love; and sometimes serious ones, as Epitaphs,
and the like. It is always soft and sweet, full
of tender Diminutives, and of Repetitions of the
same Verse at proper Distances.</p>

<p class="indent">Whether the Ancients or Moderns have deserv'd
best of these light Kinds of Poetry, but especially of
Epigram, is hard to say. It is certain, the latter
have a Turn of Wit which the former were Strangers
to; but still I dare not decide the Preference.
But leaving that Dispute, we shall all agree in this
common Maxim, <i>Inest sua gratia parvis</i>; Little
Things have their Beauty; and sometimes not a
little Beauty. Tho' they are small in Bulk, yet they
are great in Value; and not only Wit and Ingenuity
are requir'd in the Composition of them, but true
Reason, and solid Judgment:</p>

<h2>LECTURE XIII.<br /><small><i>Of Elegy.</i></small></h2>
<hr class="r65" />

<p class="indent">This is a Subject, which, if I am not
mistaken, very few have largely treated of. <i>Scaliger</i>,
indeed, and some others, have just mention'd it, and
made some short Strictures upon it: But no one,
that I know of, except <i>Vossius</i>, of the better Sort
of Writers, have writ a professed Dissertation of this
Species of Poetry, tho' it is the sweetest, the most
engaging, and every way worthy our Consideration.
Who the Inventor was, <i>Horace</i> professes himself ignorant:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i30"><i>Roscom.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nor is this an Enquiry of much Moment. Under
the Title of Elegy, is generally and primarily understood
a mournful Poem, bewailing the Loss of some
Person lately dead; and sometimes has any other
melancholy plaintive Circumstance for its Subject.
<i>Scaliger</i> calls it a Poem proper for <i>Complaints</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>Decantes elegos</i>;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>says <i>Horace</i>, addressing himself to <i>Tibullus</i>,
the best of Eleglic Writers. This appears clear enough,
from the Etymology of the Word; either from
ελεος, or (as others more justly) from ι, a Particle of Grief, and λεγειν to
<i>speak;</i> not from εν λεγειν, as some have ill judg'd, because, forsooth,
we generally speak in Praise of whose Deaths we lament.
It is certain, this Sort of Poem was anciently, and
from its first Origin, made use of at Funerals.
That, therefore, of one famous Elegiac Poet upon
the Death of another, of equal Fame, of <i>Ovid</i>, I
mean, on <i>Tibullus</i>, deserves, in the most proper
Sense, this Title: The Writer himself observes as
much, in the following Lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In wild Disorder let thy Tresses flow,</span>
<span class="i0">Thy Name now too much verify'd by Woe!</span>
</div></div>

<p>By which Words, however, he intimates, that some
other Poems, besides Funeral ones, went under the
Name of Elegies. <i>Horace</i> is very express:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
<i>Versibus impariter junctis querimonia primum,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Post etiam inclusa est voti sententia compos.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In Verses <i>long</i> and <i>short</i> Grief first appear'd,</span>
<span class="i0">In those they mourn'd past Ills, and future fear'd:</span>
<span class="i0">But soon these Lines with Mirth and Joy were fill'd,</span>
<span class="i0">And told when Fortune, or a Mistress smil'd.</span>
<span class="i35"><i>Creech.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>From whence we learn, that Deaths are not the only
Subjects of Elegy, but that by Degrees it was employ'd
upon other Things that had nothing mournful
in them, nay, that turn'd upon Gaiety and Festivity.
<i>Ovid</i>'s Books of Love, the Poems of <i>Tibullus</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
and <i>Propertius</i>, are entitled <i>Elegies</i>; and yet
so far are they from being sad, that they are sometimes
scarce serious. <i>Ovid</i>, particularly, takes too great
a Liberty in this Kind of Poem, and lets his Joy
break out to Excess. But if we look back to the
Original, both of the Name and Thing, we shall
find that Writings of this Sort are styled <i>Elegies</i>
only in an improper Sense of the Word. One and the
same Title, therefore, was indiscriminately given to
Poems on different Subjects, but which agreed in
their Verse, and Manner of Writing.</p>

<p class="indent">The chief Subjects to which Elegy owes
its Rise, are Death and Love: The Connexion between
which, it is not my Business here to examine. The
Writings of the Poets, I have above mention'd,
chiefly consist of Love; tho' Elegies admit almost of
any Matter, especially if it be treated of seriously.
The Contempt of Riches, the Pleasures of the
Country, are in great measure the Subject of them,
in which a little Love is generally interspers'd. Some,
but few, in <i>Tibullus</i> and <i>Propertius</i>, have nothing
of Death or Love; which, however, have been always
the chief Subjects of this Kind of Poem. That
Elegy, therefore, ought to be esteem'd the most perfect
in its Kind, which has somewhat of both at
once: Such, for Instance, where the Poet bewails
the Death of his <i>Corinna</i>, his <i>Delia</i>, or <i>Lycoris</i>,
or of some Youth or Damsel falling a Martyr to Love.
Among the Love Elegies, those are to be placed
next, which are full of that melancholy Complaint
which Lovers seldom want Matter for. Yet there
are some of a very different Temper; but which, as
I observ'd before, are improperly rank'd in the Number
of Elegies. Some, again, are full of Joy and Triumph: As in <i>Ovid</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
<i>Ite triumphales circum mea tempora lauri.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Triumphant Laurels, round my Temples twine.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Others satirical: As that of the same Poet, where,
describing an old Woman, he breaks out into these
Imprecations against her:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
<i>Dii tibi dent nudosque lares, inopemque senectam,</i></span>
<span class="i6"><i>Et longas hyemes, perpetuamque sitim.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">May'st thou with Poverty and Age be curst,</span>
<span class="i0">The Length of Winter, and the Summer's Thirst.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Others are jocose in different Ways, Instances of all
which we meet with in <i>Ovid</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Many Elegies are writ in the Epistolary
Manner, as is obvious, to every one that has but the least
Knowledge of the Poets I have now cited. Under
this Head, therefore, <i>Ovid</i>'s <i>Heroine</i> Epistles
(as they are usually call'd, from their being writ by Ladies
of Prowess and Renown) come very properly to be
mention'd, since they partake of the Nature of
Elegy, not only on account of their Verse, but Sentiment.
They are deservedly esteem'd the best Part
of that Poet's Works; as his Book <i>De Tristibus</i>, tho'
the truest Elegies, are the worst. Nothing can have
a more delicate Turn than some of these Epistles. I
have given Instances of this elsewhere; and have no
need of repeating them here, or producing new
ones. His <i>Heroine</i> Epistles differ from his Elegiac
in this, that the former are fictitious, and personate
the Character of some one or other mention'd in
fabulous History; the latter are address'd, in the Poet's
own Name, to his Friends of either Sex. Setting
aside this Circumstance, and that of their
Length, there is very little Difference between
them. To return, therefore, to Elegy, according to
the common Acceptation of the Word; its chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Property is to be easy and soft; to flow in one even
Current, and captivate the Ear with Melody. It
must be free from all Asperity, from every Thing
that is harsh, or unpleasant. For, as <i>Propertius</i>
sweetly expresses it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
<i>Carmina mansuetus lenia quærit Amor.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Soft flow the Lines that gentle Love indites.</span>
</div></div>

<p>And nothing is often more harmonious than Complaints;
the Music of Birds is said by the Poets to be
expressive of them, as in <i>Ovid</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>

<p>With this Kind of Poem, every Thing that is epigrammatical,
satirical, or sublime, is inconsistent.
Elegy aims not to be witty or facetious, acrimonious
or severe, majestic or sublime; but is smooth, humble,
and unaffected; nor yet is she abject in her Humility,
but becoming, elegant, and attractive.</p>

<p class="indent">Among our modern Poems, we have few entitled
Elegies; those only that are made on Funeral Occasions:
But we have many that may be call'd so,
in the larger Sense of the Word, as it was used by
the Ancients, and we have above explain'd it: Many
very ingenious ones on Love; and others of a melancholy
and soft Turn.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the Ancients, Hexameters and Pentameters
were so peculiar to Elegy, that this Kind of Metre
is usually styled <i>Elegiac</i>; nor is any more soft, or
more harmonious. Instead of it, we, in our own
Tongue, use the Heroic.</p>

<p class="indent">The Writers in this Way that Antiquity has handed
down to us, are all in <i>Latin</i>. Some there were
more early among the <i>Greeks</i>, as <i>Callimachus</i>,
<i>Philetas</i>, and others; the Fragments only of whose
Writings have been sav'd from the Wreck of Time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
They that would know which they are, may consult
the learned <i>Vossius</i>, and others; it being beside my
Purpose to enquire into Facts and History.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the <i>Latins</i>, <i>Ovid</i>, <i>Tibullus</i>,
and <i>Propertius</i>, bear the first Rank; with whom <i>Catullus</i>
is sometimes join'd: But not so properly, his Merit being
chiefly in his Hendecasyllables, and some other wanton
Verses, and his elegant Poem on the Argonautic
Expedition. There is nothing of his Elegiacal, except
the Measure of some of his Verses; and they
so uneven, that they scarce deserve the Name of
Verse; so rough, that they cannot be read without
Offence to the Ear, nay, to the very Teeth. <i>Ovid</i>
is generally reckon'd, and that deservedly, the first in
this Class, no one having equall'd his Numbers, nor
exceeded his Diction. I submit it only, for it is a
Matter of Doubt, whether <i>Tibullus</i> is not less diffuse,
and more correct. There is one Fault in <i>Ovid</i>,
which is unpardonable, his perpetual and nauseous
Repetition of <i>mei</i>, <i>tui</i>, and <i>sui</i>, in the last
Foot of his Pentameters. How much more beautiful would
they have been, if this Fault had been avoided,
which might have been done with little Care. And
yet a sixth Part, at least, are so terminated, than
which, nothing can be more lifeless and insignificant.
<i>Tibullus</i> and <i>Propertius</i> rarely fall into this
Fault, but into another, especially the latter of
them, from which <i>Ovid</i> is free; I mean the concluding
the Pentameter with Words of three or
more Syllables; whereas Harmony requires a Word
of no more than two. One Writer in this Way it
would be unpardonable to pass over, tho' we have
little remaining of him, if he is the same (as it is
probable he is not) with him to whom <i>Virgil</i> has
given Immortality by mentioning him in his Works:
For immortal, sure, he must needs be, of whom
the best of immortal Poets has given this Eulogy:

<p class="indent">This, also, is another Species of Poetry,
not professedly treated of by any of the Ancients,
nay, not so much as mention'd amongst their various
Precepts relating to this Art. The later <i>Latin</i>
Critics have bestow'd some Pains upon it; but our
modern ones, of the present Age, much more; and
(to speak my own Judgment, which I shall always be
ready to submit to better) seem to have attributed too
much Honour to it, and to have rais'd more Dust,
than the Importance of the Subject deserv'd. Not
but that I think it a very elegant Kind of Writing,
and every Way worthy of Imitation. As it is now
incumbent on me to say somewhat of it, agreeably
to my present Design, I shall put together what I
think most material relating to it, without making
any Difference between what I have advanced new,
or others have observed before me.</p>

<p class="indent">In the first Ages of the World, before Men
were united in Cities, and had learnt the studied Arts of
Luxury, they lead in the Country plain harmless
Lives; and Cottages, rather than Houses, might be
said to be their Habitation. Those happy Times
abounded with Leisure and Recreation: To feed the
Flock, and cultivate the Land, was the only Employ
of its peaceable Inhabitants; the former the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
joint Care of the Women and the Men. Hence
arose abundant Matter for Love and Verse. Nay,
when the World was grown older, and Mankind so
numerous, that they began to secure themselves in
Walls, and to introduce what we call a more civil
Life, yet still Shepherds and Husbandmen maintain'd
their primitive Honour. Country Affairs, but
especially the Care of the Flock, was not only the
Labour of the Vulgar, but the Exercise of the Rich
and Powerful, nay, of Princes of either Sex. This
appears sufficiently, from sacred History, in the Example
of <i>Jacob</i>, <i>Rachel</i>, <i>Moses</i>, and the other
Patriarchs: From the Testimony of Heathen Writers;
as in that of <i>Virgil</i>,</p>

<p>From what has been said, it is easy to see the Origin
of <i>Pastorals</i>. It appears to have been a very ancient
Species of Poetry, tho' I can by no means agree
with <i>Scaliger</i><a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>, in thinking it the oldest, which is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Honour I shall hereafter shew to be due to the Lyric
Kind, Shepherds, 'tis true, were the first Poets;
but Odes and Hymns, not Pastorals, were their original
Compositions. However, Pastorals, as I said,
are undoubtedly of very great Antiquity; and the
<i>Song of Solomon</i> in sacred Writ comes under this Denomination;
from whence, 'tis very observable, <i>Theocritus</i>
has borrow'd literally many Expressions; making
use of the Version of the Seventy-two, with whom he was cotemporary.</p>

<p class="indent">The Nature of this Kind of Poem is to
be sweet, easy, and flowing, and simple beyond all others:
And yet not so humbly simple, (which is a common
Mistake) as if it represented only the Characters of
poor ignorant Shepherds, and the Thoughts of modern
Rustics. The Scene, indeed, of Bucolics (for
that is another Name for Pastorals, the former derived
from the Herds, as the latter from the Flocks,
that are the different Objects of the rural Care) ought
always to be laid in the Country. Nor ought it to
be diversify'd with any Thing repugnant to such a
Situation; nay, Views, and little Descriptions of
Lawns and Groves, ought always to be interspers'd
in these Poems, whatsoever the Subject of them be.
Yet there may be a Mixture of Images of a different
Kind, and much elevated above the Apprehension
of the Vulgar. <i>Virgil</i>, therefore, is very
undeservedly censured by many for having introduced
Philosophy, and even somewhat of the Sublime, into
his Eclogues: For since, as we observ'd, many of the
ancient Shepherds were Persons, I need not say of
the better, but even of the first Rank, it is no great
Wonder if some of them were Scholars, and Philosophers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
'Tis a Mistake to say that <i>Virgil</i>'s fourth
and fifth Eclogues are not Pastorals; and that nothing
sublime, but every Thing simple and rustic, is
compatible with this Kind of Poetry. They are Pastorals,
undoubtedly; tho' of a different Kind from
the common ones. There is a certain Sublimity,
agreeable enough to Pastorals; a Sublimity that arises
from Philosophy and Religion, not from the
Tumults of War, the Pomps of a Court, or the
Refinements of the City. I don't see, therefore,
why that divine Eclogue; <i>Sicelides Musæ</i>, &amp;c. (divine
I may call it, on many Accounts) should not be allow'd
a Place among the Pastorals. The rural Muses
are invok'd; the Woods are celebrated; many
Things expresly relate to the Country, and nothing
repugnant to it. The Subject, indeed, is great; the
Words and Thoughts sublime; sublimer, I may say,
than the Poet himself was aware of. For it is the
Opinion of the most learned Divines, to which I
very readily adhere, that he by happy Error celebrates
from the Sibylline Oracles the Birth of <i>Christ</i>,
which was then approaching; and it is evident, that
many of the Lines describe the Nature of the Messias,
and of his Kingdom, in Terms of near Affinity
with the sacred Writings<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>.
And nothing, surely, could be more proper, than that the
Prince of Poets should promulge that joyful News in Pastorals,
which was first proclaim'd from Heaven to Shepherds.
That Objection drawn from the Invention
of War and Ships, both which the Poet touches
upon in the following Lines, is of little Moment.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>These are only incidental Ornaments of the Poem,
not properly the Subject of it. Now it is impossible
that the Argonautic Expedition, so famous throughout
the World, should be unknown to Shepherds of
Birth and Education. And as little probable is it,
that they should be ignorant of the <i>Trojan</i> War,
occasion'd by one of their own Profession. It is repugnant,
indeed, to Pastorals, to turn wholly upon
warlike Affairs; but it is a very different Thing to
bring them in only as Embellishments. This is what
may be justly pleaded for all the Eclogues of <i>Virgil</i>,
where Arms are mentioned; excepting only the tenth:</p>

<span class="i0">Detains me in the rigid Toil of Arms.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Which, I confess, raises in me some Difficulty; because
the Speaker introduc'd is manifestly a Soldier.
But it must be observ'd, that he does not at
the same Time personate a Shepherd, as is manifest,
from his Speech to the <i>Arcadians</i>, when he expresses
his Envy of their happy Retirement:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">O had kind Fortune made me one of you,</span>
<span class="i0">Keeper of Flocks, or Pruner of the Vine.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Had he been <i>one of them</i>, he would have join'd two
contradictory Ideas; for a Shepherd in Arms, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
could have born? But if it be ask'd, Why then is
the chief Person in the Pastoral drawn of a very
different Character from Pastoral; it is sufficient to
answer, That <i>Virgil</i> so thought fit; and there is nothing
absurd, or unnatural, in such a Conduct. For
the State of the Case is no more than this: <i>Gallus</i>,
engag'd in Camps, happens to fall in Love, and retires
to the Solitude of the Country, to give vent to
his Passion. Shepherds, Nymphs, <i>Sylvanus</i>, <i>Pan</i>,
and even <i>Apollo</i> himself, lend their kind Endeavours
to asswage it. Thus far every Thing is natural, elegant,
and truly pastoral. And the whole Poem is of
the same Nature, excepting only the two Verses I
have now cited. Leave out these, and even <i>Gallus</i>'s
Complaint is perfectly rural, and all the Thoughts
drawn from the Country. In short, so far am I
from assenting to those Critics who would exterminate
this from the Number of Pastorals, that I
would place it the very first of all. The sixth Eclogue
of <i>Virgil</i>, which I just now mention'd, is full of
Philosophy and Religion: And that's a sort of Sublime,
which, I before observ'd, was very consistent
with Pastoral. The fourth I have likewise spoke to.
The rest of them are Pastoral, without any Objection;
tho' the Etymology of the Word <i>Eclogue</i> by
no means implies it; which signifies no more than
<i>Select Poems upon any Subject whatsoever</i>. The Word
<i>Idyllium</i> is as little expressive of <i>Pastorals</i>, nor are
all <i>Theocritus</i>'s such: It is deriv'd from <b>eidos</b>,
Species; and the Word <i>Idyllia</i> imports no more than
<i>Poems of various Sorts</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">It must be own'd, however, that the greatest Essential
in Pastoral is <i>Simplicity</i>; and that these Lines
have much less of the Nature of it,

<p>But then it ought to be elegantly simple, for the
Plowmen should appear in their Holyday Garments.
Thus we see Shepherds and Shepherdesses introduced
upon the Stage; and tho' they bring Crooks in their
Hands, and Straw Hats on their Heads, yet their
Dress is nearly rural, and above the Habit of the
Vulgar. In <i>Virgil</i> we have frequent Examples of this
polite Rusticity, in those Places, especially, where
Love is concern'd. I shall only produce one, out
of many, where <i>Damon</i>, desperately in Love with
the fair, but cruel <i>Nisa</i>, vents his Passion in these Words:</p>

the Diction of Comedy, which is almost Prose;
nor of the bantering Satire, which is one Degree
farther from it: But is sweet, pleasant, and easy; elegant
with Plainness, and but poetically low:</p>

<p>Antique Phrases, Ænigma's, Proverbs, superstitious

<p class="indent">It generally consists of Dialogue, in which
some little dramatical Action ought to be represented, a
rural Scene described, Interlocutors under different
Circumstances, and a certain Plot carried on to a
Conclusion. For 'tis not to be imagin'd, as many,
now a-days do, that every Dialogue between two
Shepherds, full of the bleating of Flocks, is a proper

one else is dead. Say you so, says <i>Daphnis</i>, I thought
all along that <i>Pan</i> had been immortal, or <i>Phyllis</i>, I
am sure, deserv'd to have been so. They then join
in celebrating, alternately, the Praises of the deceas'd.
Birds, Sheep, Woods, Mountains, Rivers, are full
of Complaints. We are told how the croaking Raven
foreboded the dismal Event; Oaks were riv'd
with Thunder; every Thing, in short, is wondrous
lamentable, and in the most emphatical Sense miserable.</p>

<p class="indent">The Subjects of Pastoral are as various as the Passions
of human Nature, nay, it may, in some measure,
partake of every Kind of Poetry, but with this
Proviso, that the Scene of it ought always to be in
the Country, and the Thoughts never contrary to
those that are bred there. Some of these short Strictures
of Wit between contending Shepherds, favour
something of Epigram: Thus in <i>Virgil</i>;</p>

The second Eclogue is <i>Elegiac</i>, containing a Love
Complaint; so is the latter Part of the fifth, bewailing
the Death of <i>Daphnis</i>. The Songs, and Pipe,
seem reducible to some Kind of <i>Ode</i>. And I see no
Reason, why the third Eclogue may not be deem'd a
short rural <i>Comedy</i>, representing the Manners, the
Follies, little Tricks, and Quarrels of low Country
Life; intermix'd, likewise, with various Strokes of
<i>Satire</i>, many Examples of which we have elsewhere
produced. <i>Damon</i>'s Complaint; in the former Part
of the eighth Eclogue, is <i>tragical</i>, and ends thus:</p>

</div></div>

<p>But the Thoughts and Diction of the fourth Eclogue,
I before observ'd, favour much of the Heroic.</p>

<p class="indent">The Pleasure that arises from this Kind of
Poetry, is owing to those beautiful rural Scenes, which it
represents; and to that innate Love, which human
Nature, depraved as it is, still retains for its primitive
Simplicity. Simplicity and the Country I join
together, because in Fact they were both united.
We are born with a Love for a Country Life, for
Nature always pleases us more than Art, not only
as it is prior to it in Point of Time, but as the
Works of God are more perfect, and more various,
than those of Men. Nay, Art itself is then most
pleasing, when it represents Nature. Thus Architecture
affects the Mind with less Pleasure and Wonder
than Poetry, or its Sister Painting because that
is the Effect of Art only, these of Nature likewise.
And tho' it may be the Business of one Art to describe
another, yet it never is so successfully employ'd,
as when Nature sits for the Description.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Thus, in Painting, the Prospect of a magnificent
Structure is beautiful; but how much more agreeable
is <i>that</i> which is diversified with Woods, Flowers,
Rivers, Mountains, Cottages, Birds, Flocks,
Herds, and Husbandmen? And how much would
the Pleasure be still heighten'd, could the Picture
convey to us the Fragrancy of Flowers, the Warbling
of Birds, the Lowing of Oxen, the Bleating of
Sheep, and all those other Gratifications that are the
Objects, not of the Sight, but of the Hearing, and
other Senses. Since Nature, then, and the Country,
are the same, and Cities the Effect of Art and
Refinement; it is no Wonder, if the former has the
Preference. It pleads Prescription for our Choice;
if we date our own Infancy from that of the World,
we are all by Birth Inhabitants of the Fields and
Woods: Thither, therefore, we naturally tend, and,
as <i>Ovid</i> says, less justly, upon another Occasion,</p>

<p>For, I'll be bold to say, that they who prefer a City
Life, have a natural Affection for a Country one. It
is <i>Horace</i>'s Observation:</p>

<span class="i0">With doubled Force she will return again.</span>
<span class="i29"><i>Creech.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>And those that make the City Life their Choice, do
so, as the Schoolmen speak, only <i>by Accident</i>; either
to indulge their Vices and Extravagancies; or on
account of some Inconveniencies which the Country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
<i>sometimes</i> labours under; as the Want of Company,
or the Opportunity of gaining or increasing a
Fortune; not out of any Distaste of the Pleasures of
the Country. Who can help sympathizing with <i>Horace</i>'s
Citizen, and wish him Success in so reasonable a Request?</p>

<p>And it is impossible to read <i>Virgil</i>'s Description of
the Country, in his second <i>Georgic</i>, without being in
Love with the Subject, as well as the Poet. Upon
the whole, since Innocence and the Country are even
now so agreeable to human Nature, it is easy to see
from what Source the Pleasure of Pastoral Poetry springs.</p>

<p class="indent">As <i>Theocritus</i> is the first that attempted
this Way of Writing, so has he excell'd all others that have
follow'd him. <i>Virgil</i> copies, and in some Places
literally translates him. He has sometimes, however
ventur'd to deviate from his Original, by throwing in
a Mixture of the Sublime. If <i>Theocritus</i>'s are truer
Pastorals; <i>Virgil</i>'s may be said, <i>perhaps</i>, to be
the better Poems. I speak this with some Hesitation;
for, it must be own'd, the <i>Idyllia</i> are truly beautiful;
and the Author of them, I think, ought to be rank'd
among the best Poets. The Sweetness of his Versification
(owning partly to his own Ingenuity, and
partly to his Doric Dialect) is equall'd by none.

Nature, I pass over, as foreign to my Province.
Whoever is studious this Way, may consult the
Writers of poetical History. I would only observe,
that it seems universally agreed upon, that Pastoral
owes its Rise and Increase to <i>Sicily</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">I cannot but think it a Poem less suitable
to modern Times, on account of the Difference in the
Circumstances of human Life, from what it was anciently.
As the Condition of Shepherds is now
mean and contemptible; it seems too forced a Prosopop&oelig;ia
to affix to them any Character of Politeness,
or to introduce them as Men of Wealth and
Education: These Things are contradictory to
Truth, and therefore leave no Room for Fiction.
The very Foundation, then, of Pastorals, as they are
accommodated to the present Times, seems wholly
taken away. But setting aside this, it must be own'd,
several of the Moderns have attempted them very
successfully, both in their own Tongue, and in <i>Latin</i>.
The <i>Italians</i> and <i>French</i> generally want the Bucolic
Genius: Their Shepherds are too genteel; as
well bred as Citizens at least, if not as Courtiers, and
fall into other Absurdities of the same Kind. Our
Countryman <i>Spencer</i> has succeeded much better;
and one or two of the present Age seem
justly to have deserv'd the Prize.

<h2>LECTURE XV.<br />
<small><i>Of</i> <span class="smcap">Didactic</span> <i>or</i> <span class="smcap">Preceptive Poetry</span>.</small></h2>
<hr class="r65" />

<p class="indent">Human Nature, at the same Time it
is desirous of Knowledge, is cautious of confessing
its Want of it. The Precepts, therefore, design'd
for its Information, must not be obtruded with Moroseness,
but insinuated with Mildness; and even its
Vanity soothed, to remove its Ignorance. Instructions
are the better receiv'd, and sink the deeper
upon the Mind, in proportion to the Address with
which they are convey'd. There's Sort of Obsequiousness
due from the Teacher to the Scholar, and
even in this Sense that Maxim of <i>Juvenal</i> holds true:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
<span class="i0"><i>Maxima debetur puero reverentia.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>Hence it is, that Precepts deliver'd in Verse, are
imbib'd with so much Pleasure; and are held in so
great Esteem, that they constitute one distinct Species
of Poetry. Many Rules we have already given,
concerning the other Branches of it, and are now
come to teach even the Art of Teaching. Upon
this Subject I am under little Temptation of rifling
the Stores of the Learned: I don't know one that
has treated of it, except the ingenious Author of the
<i>Essay on Virgil's Georgics</i>, prefix'd to Mr. <i>Dryden</i>'s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Translation of them. And he, indeed, has so exhausted
the Subject, that it is as hard to come after
him, as it is after the great <i>Dryden</i>, or his greater Original.</p>

<p class="indent">From what has been said, it appears, that
Poetry is in its Nature adapted to deliver Precepts of any
Kind, which are sure to be learnt with more Ease,
and retain'd the more faithfully by the Help of it.
Laws, and religious Maxims, were anciently promulged
in Verse; and Priests and Poets were the
same: And even to this Day it is a prudent Custom
to have religious Lessons drawn up in Verse for the
Sake of Youth: In this Respect it may more truly be said</p>

<p>For by Poetry the very <i>Elements</i> that are taught are
soften'd into Allurements. The common Grammar,
we see, is Verse; and tho' the Language of it,
indeed, is Prose, whatever the Measure be, yet it is
a sufficient Proof, that, in the Opinion of the past and
present Age, Precepts and Poetry are no ways inconsistent:
And it were to be wish'd, that not only
Rules of Rhetoric and Logic, but of Philosophy,
and all other Sciences, were drawn up in a more entertaining
Manner. Not that <i>technical Words</i>, or
<i>Terms of Art</i>, as they are call'd, should be excluded;
for it is impossible any Science should be without
them: But they might be so dress'd up, as to invite,
not deter the Pains of the Learner. But these are
Observations less material to our Purpose, and I only
make them by the Way. I now proceed to observe,
that there are four Kinds of Didactic Poems, <i>viz.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
those that relate to moral Duties; or philosophical
Speculations; or the Business or Pleasures of Life;
or, lastly, to Poetry itself.</p>

<p class="indent">Of the <i>moral</i> Poems we shall say but
little. We have elsewhere observ'd, that these have scarce any
Thing of Poetry in them but their Measure, and
therefore hardly deserve to be class'd under the Head
of it: Such are <i>Pythagoras</i>'s <i>Golden Verses</i>; the
<i>Sentences</i> of <i>Theognis</i>; the Ποιημα Νουθετικον
of <i>Phocylides</i>. We have nothing of this Kind of the
<i>Latin</i> Writers, or of our own<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>,
worth mentioning; and, in
short, they have nothing in common with a Poem,
except this, that a Life led according to the strictest
Rules of Virtue, resembles the best, and the noblest.</p>

<p class="indent">But, on the other Hand, nothing shines
more in Verse, than Disquisitions of natural History. We
then see the strictest Reasoning join'd to the politest
Expression. Poetry and Philosophy are happily united:
The latter affords abundant Matter for Description;
it opens a large Field for Fancy, and strikes out
new Ideas, which the other expresses with suitable
Dignity. What Subject can be a more poetical one than</p>

<p>What can be more suitable to the Dignity of a
Poem, than to celebrate the Works of the great
Creator? What more agreeable to the Variety of
one, than to describe the Journies of the heavenly
Orbs, the Rise of Thunder, and other Meteors, the
Motion of the Earth, and the Tides of the Sea; the
attractive Force of the Magnet, the impulsive Motion
of Light, and the slower Progression of Sound; and
innumerable other Wonders, in the unbounded
Storehouse of Nature. I shall say nothing, at present,
of <i>Aratus</i> among the <i>Greeks</i>, or of <i>Manilius</i>
among the <i>Latin</i> Writers; <i>Lucretius</i>, alone, shall
suffice, instead of all the rest. He, indeed, is so far
from celebrating the Creator, that he supposes there
is none; but, allowing him his Hypothesis, his Poem
is truly philosophical. He had deserv'd much greater
Praise, had he corrected his Notions in Philosophy,
and his Style in Poetry; for in this Particular, also,
he is often deficient. The Asperity of his Versification
must be imputed rather to the Times he liv'd
in, (<i>viz.</i> the Age between <i>Ennius</i> and <i>Virgil</i>)
than to the Subject he treated of; which, whatever the
common Opinion be, not only admits of the Harmony
of Numbers, but requires it. The following
Directions of <i>Virgil</i> about burning the Turf, part of
which we cited before, upon another Occasion, don't
lose any Thing of their Philosophy by their Smoothness:

<p>But sometimes, likewise, when he unfolds the Principles
of Matter, the Causes of Things, and the
Phænomena of Nature. It is certain, <i>Virgil</i> is much
indebted to him, tho' he has much improv'd his Manner.</p>

<p class="indent">Another Imperfection in <i>Lucretius</i> is,
that he never makes any Excursions into poetical Fiction.
Some Digressions he has, but they are rather philosophical,
than poetical; and therefore don't diversify
the Subject, nor afford the Reader sufficient Refreshment.
He has some, indeed, philosophical; but
then they are impious, such as reason against Providence,
the Foundations of Religion, and the Immortality
of the Soul. One, however, I must except,
that upon the Plague of <i>Athens</i>; which contains, indeed,
a poetical Description, but nothing of poetical
Fable. It must be own'd, this Poet reasons too
much in the Manner of the Schools, the Philosopher
appears too open, he wants the Gentility to
conceal his Beard, and temper his Severity. Poetry
and Philosophy, indeed, were both to be join'd together,
but the one ought to be as the Handmaid to
the other; which <i>Virgil</i> would not have fail'd to have
taken care of, had he been engag'd on such a Subject.
Not so <i>Lucretius</i>, who appears more a Philosopher
than a Poet, and yet of Poets not the meanest: <i>Virgil</i>,
in his <i>Georgics</i>, appears more a Poet than a Husbandman,
and yet of Husbandmen the greatest.</p>

<p class="indent">I can't see why, in a Work of this Kind,
Nature may not be so explain'd, as to admit sometimes of
poetical Fiction; in the same Manner that <i>Virgil</i> describes
the <i>Cyclops</i> forging the Thunderbolts?

</div></div>

<p>Here the Formation of the Thunder is poetically
feign'd; the Matter and the Adjuncts explain'd physically;
Philosophy is made the Basis, and Poetry the Superstructure.</p>

<p class="indent">I know of no modern Poem of this Sort worth
mentioning, except <i>Buchanan's Sphere</i>, which is a
Work by no means contemptible. But as Natural
Philosophy has, by the Help of Experiments, been
lately brought to much greater Perfection than ever;
this Kind of Poetry, no doubt, would have made
proportionable Advances, if the same Age that shew'd
a <i>Boyle</i>, a <i>Halley</i>, and a <i>Newton</i>, had produc'd
a <i>Virgil</i>; or if we had not been so much worse Poets
than the Ancients, as we are better Philosophers.
We have, indeed, some poetical Essays on the<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
<i>Circulation of the Blood</i>, the <i>Air-pump</i>, the <i>Microscope</i>,
and the <i>Telescope</i>, and the like: But these are short
<i>Descriptions</i>, no ways reducible to the Species of
Poetry before us. 'Tis true, they may in some Sense
be reduc'd under the Title of <i>Didactic</i>, tho' not of
<i>Preceptive</i> Poetry; they <i>teach</i> by <i>Description</i>,
not by <i>Precept</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">But the next Kind I mention'd, relating to the
<i>Business</i> or <i>Pleasures</i> of Life, do both. Under this
Head <i>Virgil</i>'s <i>Georgics</i> stand foremost, containing the
most useful Rules for Husbandry in all its Branches,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Agriculture, the Method of raising Trees, or Cattle,
or tending of Bees. The Pleasure that naturally results
from reading them, is chiefly owing to the
Pleasure and Advantage which attends a Country
Life. Here <i>Virgil</i> has <i>imitated Hesiod</i>, as he has
<i>Theocritus</i> in his Eclogues, and <i>Homer</i> in the <i>Æneis</i>;
I should rather have said, has <i>exceeded</i> each in their
peculiar Way of Writing, unless, perhaps, we ought
to except <i>Theocritus</i>: But <i>Hesiod</i> he his left so far
behind him, that he scarce deserves to be mention'd
in the Comparison. The good old Man of <i>Ascræa</i>
is at best but a downright Yeoman, whereas <i>Virgil</i>
appears with the Learning of a Scholar, and the Elegance
of a Gentleman. From his <i>Georgics</i>, then, all
the Maxims that relate to this Subject must be illustrated.</p>

<p class="indent">The first Rule I would lay down, is, That we
ought to select with Judgment such Circumstances
as are capable of shining in Verse; not that we are
to omit the gravest Precepts, but to express them by
their most poetical Adjuncts:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>I need not explain myself any farther. To produce
all the Instances of this Kind, would be to transcribe
the <i>Georgics</i>. 'Tis with the same View the great Author
of them is so copious upon the different Properties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
of Trees and Cattle; the Combat of Bulls;
the Conduct and Politics of Bees, and the like.</p>

<p class="indent">To vary the Form of Instruction, and to add
Life to his Precepts, he sometimes instils them as Matters
of Fact, and conveys them under the Appearance of a Narration:</p>

<span class="i0">Thou shalt behold, and from a shaken Oak</span>
<span class="i0">Thy hungry Appetite in Woods relieve.</span>

<p>Or he describes the ill Effects he has observ'd to attend it:</p>

<span class="i0">Long try'd, and chosen, oft they have been prov'd Degen'rate.</span>

<p>By this agreeable Variety the Reader's Attention is
wonderfully awaken'd, tho' he sees not the Reason of
it; and the Poet's Art is the more to be admir'd, because
it escapes Observation.</p>

<p class="indent">But the greatest Ornaments of this sort of
Poems, are the frequent <i>Excursions</i> into some more noble
Subject, which seem'd naturally to arise out of that
the Poet is treating of. Sometimes, for Instance,
he runs back into <i>History</i> and <i>Antiquity</i>,
or, perhaps, the very Origine of Things:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas <i>Ceres</i> first taught Mortals with the Share</span>
<span class="i0">To cut the Ground.</span>

<p>Sometimes he makes Reflections on the Condition
of Human Life:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">First flies away: Diseases, sick Old Age,</span>
<span class="i0">And Pain, and Death's Inclemency, succeed.</span>
</div></div>

<p>At another Time he heightens his Subject with
<i>Astronomy</i>, and <i>Natural Philosophy</i>; an Instance of
which I have already cited, from the <i>Georgics</i>: But
I cannot help adding one more, not only as it makes
very remarkably for our present Purpose, but is,
moreover, an abundant Proof of what I before advanc'd,
that Natural Philosophy might be express'd
in the sweetest Numbers, and consequently is capable
of much smoother Versification than that of <i>Lucretius</i>.
The Poet, then, having mention'd the Noise
of Crows as a Sign of fair Weather, proceeds thus:</p>

<span class="i0">And the moist Ether what before was dense</span>

<span class="i0">The shifting Phantasms of their Minds are turn'd;</span>
<span class="i0">And now within their Breasts new Passions move,</span>

<span class="i0">Chirping in Chorus; hence the Joy of Beasts,</span>
<span class="i0">And Flocks of Crows exulting in the Fields.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Often he digresses into <i>Fable</i> and <i>Fiction</i>, as in that
beautiful Episode of <i>Orpheus</i> and <i>Eurydice</i>: And still
more often into <i>poetical Descriptions</i>, as those of the
perpetual Spring in <i>Italy</i>, and the bleak Winter in
<i>Scythia</i>; of the Happiness of a Country Life; of
the various Prognostications of the Weather; of the
Prodigies that foretold the Death of <i>Cæsar</i>; and, to
name no more, of the Murrain among the Cattle.
Of which, I wonder the foremention'd Author of
the <i>Essay on Virgil's Georgics</i> should say, that <i>Virgil</i>
seems in it to have summon'd up all his Might to
equal the Description of the Plague in <i>Lucretius</i>,
since the one is as much beyond the other in the Ingenuity
of the Composition, as it is inferior to it, in
the Dignity of the Subject; and the Plague in <i>Lucretius</i>
is exceeded by that of <i>Virgil</i>, as much as Beasts
are by Men. Upon the whole, this is deservedly
esteem'd the most finish'd Piece of all <i>Virgil</i>'s Works;
I need not add, that it is the compleatest in its Kind,
of any we now have, or the World ever saw.</p>

<p class="indent">The Moderns have produc'd nothing in this Kind,
except <i>Rapin</i>'s Books of Gardening, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
celebrated Poem on Cyder by an ingenious Author, that
not long since resided among us; who, if he had
enjoy'd the Advantage of <i>Virgil</i>'s Language, would
have been second to <i>Virgil</i> in a much nearer Degree.
As long as the fluctuating State of our Tongue
will permit, this <i>English Georgic</i> shall infallibly flourish,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;<i>&amp; honos erit huic quoque Pomo.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And to this Apple Honours shall be paid.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Among the <i>Pleasures</i> of a Country Life, we may
reckon <i>Hunting</i>, <i>Fishing</i>, <i>Hawking</i>, and the like;
which are excellent Subjects for Didactic Verse, and
are very fruitful of poetic Matter. We have only
some Essays of this Sort, and those by modern
Hands, except only <i>Gratius</i>'s <i>Cynægeticon</i>, which
owes all its Value to Fortune, rather than any true
Merit of its own; <i>viz.</i> that it has the Advantage of
being writ in the <i>Augustan</i> Age, and being recommended
by <i>Ovid</i>, a Contemporary, in the following Verse,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Aptaque venanti Gratius arma dabit.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And <i>Gratius</i> to the Hunter Arms supplies.</span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Oppian</i>'s <i>Halieutica</i> and <i>Cynegetica</i> are scarce
to be reckon'd among the Writings of the Ancients, but
to be plac'd rather in the Middle Age<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">The Rules for writing upon these Subjects are the
same with what I have mention'd under the <i>Georgics</i>;
I have no Occasion, therefore, to add new ones here.
The same may be said for that Species of Poetry,
that consists in teaching the <i>Art of Poetry</i>; the Manner of
Writing is the same, as far as the Difference of the Matter will admit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The Pieces that have been writ in this Way,
are known to all; and Poetry seems never to have employ'd
her Time better, than upon herself. The
Ancients have left us only one Specimen of this
Kind, but such as may compensate for all the rest,
<i>Horace</i>'s Epistle to the <i>Piso's</i>; a Work that
ought to be got by Heart by all true Lovers of Poetry, in
which 'tis hard to say, whether we should admire
the Wit or Judgment most, both in the Choice of
the Precepts, and the Manner of delivering them.
Among the Moderns, the celebrated <i>French</i> Poet<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>,
and several of our Countrymen<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>,
have succeeded, each in his native Tongue, very happily.</p>

<p class="indent">These are the several Kinds of Didactic
Poetry, with which the Writers of the past or present Age
have furnish'd us. In this Number I might reckon
Ovid <i>of the Art of Love</i>; but I pass it by, on
account of its Levity, not to say its Indecency. Much
less excusable are <i>Claudius Quilletus</i>, and <i>Hieronymus
Fracastorius</i>, among the Moderns; who, it were to
be wish'd, had chosen Subjects less obnoxious to Censure.</p>

<p class="indent">I would, however, observe, that any Thing
in the World may be the Subject of this Kind of Poem:
The Business or Recreations of the City, or the
Country; even the Conduct of common Life, and
civil Converse: But none more suitable than Arts
and Sciences. And among those, which of them so
proper to receive Instructions from the Hand of
Poetry, as its two Sister Arts, Painting and Music?
In the former, particularly, there is Room for the
most entertaining Precepts concerning the Disposal
of Colours; the Arrangement of Lights and Shades;
the secret Attractives of Beauty; the various Ideas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
which make up that one; the distinguishing between
the Attitudes proper to either Sex, and every Passion;
the representing Prospects, of Buildings, Battles,
or the Country; and, lastly, concerning the Nature
of Imitation, and the Power of Painting. What
a boundless Field of Invention is here? what Room
for Description, Comparison, and poetical Fable?
How easy the Transition, at any Time, from the
Draught to the Original, from the Shadow to the
Substance? And, from hence, what noble Excursions
may be made into History, into Panegyric upon the
greatest Beauties or Hero's of the past or present
Age? The Task, I confess, is difficult; but, according
to that noted, but true Saying,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
So are all Things that are great. Let the Man, therefore, that
is equal to such an Undertaking, be fir'd with a noble
Ambition to attempt a Work untouch'd before;
and let the <i>Georgics</i>, which have been our great Example,
furnish him with this noble Incentive:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Since, then, it is incumbent upon me to bear a Part
in this Solemnity, let me prevail with my usual Audience,
and those additional Guests that make up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
this chearful Assembly, to restrain their Impatience
for the Verses and Orations, that are to follow, only
while I lay before them the Original and Antiquity of
Lyric Poetry, the distinguishing Properties of it, the
Variety of its Matter, and the Difference between
modern Writers in this Way, and the ancient.</p>

<p class="indent">That this is the most ancient Kind of Poem, is
pretty evident. <i>Jubal</i>, in sacred Writ, is said to be
the first Inventor of musical Instruments; and little
Doubt is to be made, but vocal Music was added to
them. And we are farther told, by a <i>Jewish</i> Author,
of venerable Antiquity<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>,
tho' his Works are not admitted
into the Canon, that the same <i>which found
out musical Tunes, recited Verses in Writing</i>. We
have before observ'd, that Poetry took its Rise from
those Festival Hymns which were sung at the Conclusion
of Harvest, in Gratitude to the Deity. Odes,
therefore, and Poetry, date their Original from the
same Æra: And, in Truth, if we consider the internal
Motions of the Soul, it will seem very probable
that Poetry, which is so peculiarly adapted to
express the several Emotions of Joy, or Praise, or
Gratitude, owes its Rise to Nature herself, and was
therefore join'd with Music. We have no Instance
of Poetry older than the celebrated Song, or rather
Ode, of <i>Moses</i><a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>.
The Antiquity of the other Hymns
mention'd in sacred History, and, particularly, the
Collection of them in the Book of <i>Psalms</i>, is so well
known, that I shall dwell no longer upon this Particular.</p>

<p class="indent">As to the Nature of the Lyric Poem, it is,
of all Kinds of Poetry, the most poetical; and is as distinct,
both in Style, and Thought, from the rest, as
Poetry in general is from Prose. I have before observ'd,
the Peculiarity of its Diction; the Thought,
only, now comes under Consideration. Now this is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the boldest of all other Kinds, full of Rapture, and
elevated from common Language the most that is
possible; so that what <i>Horace</i> says at the Beginning of
one of his Odes, may not improperly be applied to all the rest:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
<i>Odi profanum vulgus, &amp; arceo.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I hate, I scorn the Vulgar Throng.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Some Odes there are, likewise, in the free and loose
Manner, which seem to avoid all Method, and yet
are conducted by a very clear one; which affect
Transitions, seemingly, without Art, but, for that
Reason, have the more of it; which are above Connexion,
and delight in Exclamations, and frequent
Invocation of the Muses; which begin and end abruptly,
and are carried on thro' a Variety of Matter
with a sort of divine <i>Pathos</i>, above Rules and Laws,
and without Regard to the common Forms of Grammar.</p>

<p class="indent">Hence, then, we learn the chief Property of Lyric
Poetry, <i>viz.</i> that it abounds with a Sort of Liberty
which consists in Digressions and Excursions.
<i>Pindar</i> set his Successors this Example, insomuch
that this Style, when applied to Odes, is generally
call'd Pindaric; not that he is to be esteem'd the Inventor
of it: For it is plain that he, and the rest of
the <i>Grecians</i>, receiv'd their Learning from the Nations
of the East, the <i>Jews</i> and <i>Ph&oelig;nicians</i>: And it
is well known, the eastern Eloquence abounded not
only with Metaphors, and bold Hyperboles, but in
long Digressions; as is sufficiently evident from the
sacred Writings. The <i>Roman Pindar</i> often imitates
the <i>Theban</i>, and sometimes exceeds him, even in his
characteristic Excellence. Thus in that Ode, where
he addresses himself to the Ship that bore so valuable
a Freight as <i>Virgil</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
<i>Sic te, Diva potens Cypri</i>, &amp;c.</span>
</div></div>

<p>at the Conclusion of the eighth Verse, he inveighs
against the Temerity of Mankind, and pursues this
Argument to the End of the Ode, which is not a
very short one. So, again, speaking of the Tree
which had like to have fallen upon him,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
<i>Ille &amp; nefasto te posuit die</i>, &amp;c.</span>
</div></div>

<p>a few Lines after he adds;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Quam pene furvæ regna Proserpinæ</i>,</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Et judicantem vidimus Æacum</i>,</span>

<span class="i0">How near was I to Realms of Night?</span>
<span class="i0">Where <i>Minos</i> does in Judgment sit;</span>

<span class="i0">By what disastrous Cause she fell:</span>

<span class="i30"><i>Oldsw.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>He then expatiates into their Praises, and so concludes
this elegant Ode with them. It is, indeed, just
Matter of Complaint, that we have only some Fragments
of both these Poets remaining, to whom we
owe the Invention of the two chief Kinds of Lyric
Poetry. In this loose Way of Writing, the Poet just touches
upon the Subject at first propos'd, and strait diverts to another:

<p>Nothing can describe the unbounded Nature of this
Kind of Ode better than those Lines of <i>Horace</i>,
which, at the same Time, give us a lively Instance of
it. We may add, to the same Purpose, his Description
of the <i>Theban</i> Poet;</p>

<span class="i30"><i>Oldsworth.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>From what has been said, some will be induc'd to
think, that to write a Lyric Poem, which is indulg'd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
with so many Liberties, is the easiest Thing imaginable:
But, in Reality, it is the most difficult in every
Respect, except its Shortness, as it is the most elegant.
It demands not only a flowing Imagination,
Brightness, Life, Sublimity, and Elegance, but the
nicest Art, and finest Judgment, so as to seem luxuriant,
and not to be so; and under the Shew of
transgressing all Laws, to preserve them. For it is
not impossible but a Writer's Fire may be temper'd
with the severest Judgment; and Poets may be said,
tho' Lovers cannot, to be <i>mad with Reason</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Those Digressions which quite leave the
Subject, and never return to it again, please me less than
some others of a very different Kind. The former,
no doubt, are defensible, and sometimes highly commendable;
for a Poet is not always oblig'd to dwell
upon the same Argument from one End to the
other; and I would rather call them Transitions,
than Digressions: But the Digressions which I chiefly
admire, are such as <i>take Occasion</i> from some <i>Adjunct</i>
or <i>Circumstance</i> of the Subject, to pass on to <i>somewhat
else</i> not totally distinct from it, with which the
Imagination having been diverted for some Time,
new Matter starts up, and from some new Adjunct of
that, the Poet is brought back, of a sudden, to his
first Design. I cannot produce a better Instance of
this, out of <i>Horace</i> himself, than from a late Ode of
one of our own Countrymen<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>,
who, since he has paid the Debt of Nature, may, without
Envy, receive the Tribute of our Praise; that beautiful Ode,
I mean, upon the Death of the famous Dr. <i>Pocock</i>;
where the Poet describes his Travels to the East, in these Words<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>:

Purpose, that he may bring in a beautiful Description
of <i>Babel</i>, and the Confusion of Tongues:
Then, with no less Elegance, he returns to the
Praise of his venerable Traveller, surprizingly skill'd
in most of them. Afterwards, with a peculiar Delicacy,
his Comment upon <i>Joel</i> is hinted at, and
from thence Occasion taken to represent that terrible
Day of the Lord, which the Prophet speaks of,
and then the holy Ardour of his Interpreter:</p>

<p>The Matter and Thoughts are sublime and elegant,
the Transitions artful; and it is, in short, all over wonderful.</p>

<p class="indent">This, likewise, is a Peculiarity in Lyric Poetry,
that (as the Name implies) it is attended with musical
Instruments more than any other. <i>More than
any other</i>, I say, because there's no Necessity that
Odes should be always sung; they are often repeated:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Nor is Music so peculiar to them, as to be suitable
to no other Poems; for the Flute was anciently
join'd with Elegy; and now a-days we see other
Kinds of Poetry accompanied with Music, nay,
even Prose itself; tho' anciently, I say, it was thought
more <i>peculiarly</i> adapted to the Ode. Hence we find
many Ideas among the Lyrics, that we meet with
no where else; hence the frequent mention of musical
Instruments, I may say the frequent Invocation of them.</p>

<p>Which are Circumstances that often throw an additional
Ornament on a Poem.</p>

<p class="indent">The Ancients have left us very imperfect
Accounts of their Music. They that would see a Description
of their chief Instruments, the Harp and
Flute, may consult <i>Vossius</i>, and others. But the
Manner of their <i>Composing</i> has been scarce touch'd
upon by any. For my Part, I cannot but think it
was more simple than our modern Way, and consisted
of fewer Divisions. And my Reason is, because we
meet with very few Encomiums of this Art, or of
those that excell'd in it; nay, scarce any of their
Names are handed down to Posterity. There's frequent
mention, indeed, among the Lyrics, of musical
Instruments, as Adjuncts of that Kind of Poetry;
but it is scarce credible the Ancients should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
have said so little of this Art, if it had flourish'd as
much in their Time, as it does in ours. As, therefore,
we are much inferior to them in Lyric Poetry,
so in its Sister Science we far exceed them. We
have not their <i>Horaces</i>; nor had they those masterly
Hands which are now, or lately have been the Admiration
of all <i>Europe</i>; none to be compar'd with
our <i>British Orpheus</i><a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>, or his worthy Successor<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>,
that receives, on this Day, Academical Honours.</p>

<p class="indent">The proper Subjects for <i>Odes</i>, are almost all
comprehended in the following Lines of <i>Horace</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Gods, Heroes, Conquerors, <i>Olympic</i> Crowns,</span>

<span class="i33"><i>Roscom.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>Heroes and Triumphs, we before observ'd to be the
principal Subjects; and <i>Horace</i>, accordingly, places
them first. But, in Course of Time, Love and Entertainments
were likewise thought very suitable
ones. <i>Horace</i> has left us several of both Sorts, writ
with a Sweetness and Elegance that always distinguish
him: Nay, he more than once insinuates, that
light Subjects come peculiarly within his Province,
and that he stands in need of Apology when he presumes
to meddle with greater:</p>

<p>But these Expressions are the Effects of the Poet's
Modesty, not to be understood critically; not as
spoken of Lyrics in general, but of his own, which
with a becoming Decency, he says, are unequal to
greater Subjects. For the Ode in its own Nature is
<i>chiefly</i> adapted to the Sublime; and nothing can
have more of that Quality than some of <i>Horace</i>'s.

which relates to moral Reflections; which not only
affords the greatest Advantage to the Reader, but,
for aught I know, the greatest Elegance to the Writer.
Many of his Odes are full of it:</p>

<p>These moral Odes are often interspers'd with Encomiums

<p>Upon the whole, then, we see, that the Ode may be
either Sublime, or of the lower Strain; jocose or serious;
mournful or exulting; even satirical sometimes,
epigrammatical never. It may consist of Wit,
but not of that Turn which is the peculiar Characteristic
of Epigram. They that have a Mind to know
the various Classes of Odes, with their uncouth Titles,
into which they are by some Writers distinguish'd;
may consult <i>Vossius</i>, <i>Scaliger</i>, and others.
This to me is an Enquiry not more superfluous than
disagreeable; since any Thing, we find, may be the
Subject of them, if they are but dress'd up in their
own peculiar Manner.</p>

<p class="indent">From whence the Pleasure arises with which this
Kind of Poetry affects us, may be known from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
what we have before discours'd of the Pleasure of
Poetry in general, when we examin'd how it address'd
itself to the Passions, the common Principles
of human Nature, and human Happiness. I would
only now observe, that what we said of Poetry in
general, is applicable to the Lyric more particularly:
Besides the Advantages of a florid and figurative
Style, it commands that Sweetness and Variety
of Numbers; that Diversity of Thought; that Elegance
of Conciseness; that Energy of Expression;
that Quickness of Transition, and Liberty of Excursion;
that lively Ardour, and noble Sublimity,
which can never fail to raise in the Soul all those agreeable
Sensations, we before describ'd.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not my Design to give an historical
Account of the ancient Writers in this Kind of Poetry:
<i>Vossius</i> reckons up several among the <i>Greeks</i> of
both Sexes; we have nothing but Fragments of all of
them remaining, except the Poems of <i>Pindar</i> and
<i>Anacreon</i>. The former I have already spoke of;
those of the latter are so few, and the peculiar Nature
of them so well known, that tho' they deserve
much Praise, they need no farther Explication.
Among the <i>Romans</i>, we have none of any Note, except
<i>Horace</i>; but he, alone, indeed, is equal to many;
and we may venture to affirm, that his Odes exceed
any Collection of Poems the learned World has yet been bless'd with.</p>

<p class="indent">To come now to later Times; it must be
own'd, the Moderns are excell'd by the Ancients in no Kind
of Writing more than this; they succeed best, when
they make use of their Language; for many of the
Moderns are very good Masters of it. <i>Casimire</i> is
often very happy this Way; but often harsh, turgid,
and pompously empty; of which the present Solemnity
reminds me of one Instance. The Poet is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
speaking in Praise of a Peace lately made; and after
he had begun well enough,</p>

<span class="i0"><i>Jam prophanatis male pulsa terris</i></span>

<p>he goes on thus,</p>

<i>Grandinat gemmis, riguoque cælum</i></span>
<span class="i10"><i>Depluit auro.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Verses are smooth and sonorous; only they have
the Misfortune to want common Sense. But in another
Ode he is much happier, unless, perhaps, a little
too bold:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>

<span class="i0"><i>Mensium lunæ, nimiumque volvi</i></span>
<span class="i10"><i>Lubricus Æther.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the Lines that follow, a little after, are perfectly
just, and beautiful:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Quod tibi larga dedit hora dextra,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hora furaci rapuit sinistra;</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>More fallentis tenerum jocosæ</i></span>
<span class="i10"><i>Matris alumnum.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Our <i>Hannes</i> needed only to have writ
more to have made himself second to <i>Horace</i> in all
future Ages. But the Odes that are writ in the
modern Languages, in <i>French</i>, <i>Italian</i>, and <i>English</i>,
have nothing of the Genius of the Ancients. Ours,
which generally go under the Name of <i>Pindarics</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
are such empty, trifling Performances, that they are
below even the Censure of a Critic. A Heap of
Verses, tho' never so insipid and ridiculous, form'd
as little upon the Laws of Reason, as of Metre, a
monstrous Product of the Brain, shall be call'd, forsooth,
a <i>Pindaric</i>! a Scandal which it is to be wish'd
the Learned would no longer suffer to be offer'd to
so sacred a Title. Our Songs and Catches, likewise,
which are daily set to Music, whatever Charms they
may borrow from thence, have very rarely any of
their own; nay, it is observable, that often the worst
Verses are set to Music best; as if true Poetry, and
good Music, Sisters as they are, cou'd never agree:
Which is a Reproach that redounds no less to the
Dishonour of Music, than the former, I just mention'd,
was to <i>Pindar</i>. But better Times appear, in
which we hope to see these, and all other Arts, improv'd
to their utmost Perfection; in this happy
Age, I mean, wherein (that I may conclude my
Discourse as I began, with a View at once to our
present Solemnity, and our present Subject)</p>

<h2>LECTURE XVII, XVIII.<br /><small><i>Of</i> <span class="smcap">Satire</span>.</small></h2>
<hr class="r65" />

<p class="indent">It is Merit enough for a Writer on a Subject
that has been often canvass'd, if he can reduce into a
short Compass whatever hath been said before, and
add something material of his own. Whether I have
done this in the present Case, must be submitted to
the Judgment of the Audience; I am sure I shall
make it my Endeavour, not only to represent my
own Sentiments in an advantageous Light, but those
of others; for I have a large Field of Writers before
me, on this Subject; not only <i>Horace</i>, <i>Quintilian</i>,
and the rest of the Ancients, but the learned <i>Casaubon</i>,
<i>Scaliger</i>, <i>Vossius</i>, <i>Dacier</i>, and some others.</p>

<p class="indent">A Difficulty occurs upon our first Entrance;
for a Doubt has been made about the Name of <i>Satire</i>,
and the Orthography of it: The Reason of which
Doubt will appear, from the uncertain History we
have of this Kind of Poem. It cannot be denied,
but that the <i>Grecian</i> Satire differ'd from the <i>Roman</i>;
but yet the Difference seems not so great, as some
are apt to imagine: The former was of the dramatic
Kind, a Sort of Interlude annex'd to Tragedy, to
remove from the Audience too melancholy Impressions.
It is <i>Horace</i>'s Observation,

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The first Tragedians found that serious Style</span>
<span class="i0">Too grave for their uncultivated Age,</span>
<span class="i0">And so brought wild and naked Satires in,</span>
<span class="i0">(Whose Motion, Words, and Shape, were all a Farce)</span>
<span class="i0">As oft as Decency wou'd give them Leave;</span>
<span class="i0">Because the mad ungovernable Rout,</span>

<span class="i0">Lov'd such Variety, and Antic Tricks.</span>

</div></div>

<p>The <i>Scene</i> was laid in the Country, the <i>Persons</i>
Satyrs, and rural Deities. Sometimes Peasants and Rustics
were mix'd with them. The Subject was jocose,
and full of Sneer and Banter; the Style a Medium
between Comedy and Tragedy. This, as I
said, was the satirical Poetry of the <i>Grecians</i>; but
Satire, as we now have it, is entirely <i>Roman</i>, if we
may believe <i>Quintilian</i>, who says<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>,
<i>Satira quidem tota nostra est</i>; or
<i>Horace</i><a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>,
who styles <i>Ennius</i> the <i>Inventor of a Poem unknown to
the</i> Grecians, meaning <i>Satire</i>, according to the Opinion
of most of his Interpreters. <i>Scaliger</i>, however, expresly denies
it to be of <i>Roman</i> Original; and there is Reason, indeed,
as we shall see hereafter, to understand those
Expressions of <i>Quintilian</i> and <i>Horace</i> with some
Abatement. Those that will not allow it to be deriv'd
from the <i>Grecians</i>, but entirely <i>Roman</i>, maintain,
that <i>Satira</i> should be writ with an <i>i</i>, not a <i>y</i>;
and that it is not deriv'd from <i>Satyrus</i>, but <i>Satur</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
<i>Satira</i>, therefore, is the same as <i>Satura</i>, as <i>Maximus</i>
anciently <i>Maxumus</i>. Now <i>Satur</i> signifies <i>full</i> of
a Mixture of Things, as <i>Lanx Satura</i>, a Dish full
of Varieties; and, as <i>Dacier</i> observes<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>,
"those Laws were call'd <i>Leges Saturæ</i><a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>,
which contain'd several Heads and Titles under them; as the
<i>Julian-Papian-Poppæan</i> Law, which was otherwise
call'd the <i>Miscella</i>, which is but another Word
for <i>Satura</i>. Hence that Expression, <i>per Saturam
legem ferre</i>, when the Votes of the Senators were
not taken in Order, or counted, but were given
together promiscuously. And this is properly
<i>per Saturam sententias exquirere</i>, which is an Expression
<i>Sallust</i> makes use of after <i>Lælius</i>. Nor
is this all; some Books anciently bore this Title;
as <i>Pescennius Festus</i> left <i>Historias Saturas</i>, or
<i>per Saturam</i>." Thus far <i>Dacier</i>. <i>Satire</i>, then,
when applied by a Metaphor to Writing, is a Miscellaneous
Poem, full of Variety of Matter: According to that of <i>Juvenal</i>,</p>

</div></div>

<p>But however various the Matter of it is, it ought
always to have somewhat of Keenness and Invective,
to expose the Vices and Follies of Mankind with
Raillery, or chastise them with Severity. Before
Plays were brought to <i>Rome</i>, the <i>Saturnine</i> and
<i>Fescennine</i> Verses were much in Vogue: They were a
Sort of rude and unpolish'd Compositions, at best,
full of Contumely, and often of Ribaldry. Whence <i>Horace</i>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
<i>Fescennina per hunc inventa licentia morem</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Versibus alternis opprobria rustica fudit.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hence grew the Liberty of the looser Muse,</span>
<span class="i0">Hence they grew scurrilous, and wou'd abuse.</span>
<span class="i34"><i>Creech.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>Afterwards, as the <i>Romans</i> grew more polite, these
kind of Verses refin'd in Proportion: But they retain'd,
still, their Jibes and Banter and kept so far
to their first Institution, as to make the Follies of
human Life the Object of their Ridicule. From
hence proceeded <i>Satire</i>, so call'd from the <i>Farrago</i>
and Variety of Matter it contain'd. It was improv'd,
likewise, with Music and Dancing, which, considering
its being carried on in Dialogue, made it resemble
somewhat of the dramatic Kind; nor had
the <i>Romans</i> any Thing, yet, that came so near the
Drama as this did. Afterwards, when they had receiv'd
both Tragedy and Comedy from the <i>Grecians</i>,
they were so taken with the Novelty, that Satire,
for some Time, lay neglected. But coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
again into Esteem, it was added, as a Kind of <i>Exodium</i>,
to Comedy. Thus Things went on for some
Years, till <i>Ennius</i> arose, endu'd with Wit, and
true poetic Fire, who observing how fond the People
were of seeing the Vices of Mankind expos'd upon
the Stage, thought a Poem on the same Subject,
without the Decoration of Scenes and Action, might
have the same Effect. Accordingly, he attempted
Satires in the same Form we now see them, only he
did not confine himself to the Hexameter, but made
use of all Sorts of Measure. The Remains we have
of this Poet, are noble Indications of the Strength
of his Genius; and <i>Horace</i> and <i>Virgil</i> have shewn
what Opinion they had of his Writings, by borrowing
so much from them. After <i>Ennius</i>, succeeded
<i>Pacuvius</i>; but his Works are all lost, excepting some
Fragments, and those of uncertain Authority. Next
came <i>Lucilius</i>, of whom, likewise, we have only
some Fragments remaining. But his Excellencies
and Imperfections are very amply set forth by <i>Horace</i>,
whose Words I have no Occasion to cite here.
I would observe, however, that those Lines,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
&mdash;<i>Quid, cum est Lucilius ausus</i></span>
<span class="i3"><i>Primus in hunc operis componere carmina morem?</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How, Sir, <i>Lucilius</i>, that did first engage</span>
<span class="i0">In writing Satires, and that lash'd the Age.</span>
<span class="i34"><i>Creech.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>are not so to be understood, as if he was the first
that attempted Satire; which both <i>Ennius</i> and <i>Pacuvius</i>,
as we just now observ'd, had done before him:
But that <i>Lucilius</i> improv'd it so far as to give it that
new Face, under which it appear'd in <i>Horace</i>'s Time:
For that his Satires were of the same Form with
<i>Horace</i>'s, is maintain'd by Monsieur <i>Dacier</i> against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
<i>Casaubon</i><a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>.
It must be allow'd, however, that one
Species of Satire owes its Perfection to <i>Horace</i>, as
another does to <i>Juvenal</i>; both which we shall hereafter
speak of separately. A third Kind was the <i>Varronian</i>
or <i>Menippean</i> Satire, so call'd from <i>Menippus</i>,
a Cynic Philosopher, among the <i>Grecians,</i> whose
Doctrine <i>Varro</i> follow'd. It was a Sort of Medley,
consisting not only of all Kinds of Verse, but of
Verse and Prose mix'd together; a Specimen of
which we have in <i>Petronius</i>'s <i>Satyricon</i><a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>.
We have none of <i>Varro</i>'s poetical Works remaining, except
some small Fragments; which is the more to be lamented,
considering the Character <i>Quintilian</i> gives
of him, That he was the most learned of all the <i>Romans</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The Word <i>Satire</i> was anciently taken in a
less restrain'd Sense than it is at present, not only as denoting
a severe Poem against Vice, but as consisting
of Precepts of Virtue, and the Praises of it: And
even in the Satires, as they are call'd, of <i>Horace</i>,
<i>Juvenal</i>, and <i>Persius</i>, &amp;c. which are principally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
levell'd against the Weakness, the Follies, or Vices of
Mankind; we find many Directions, as well as Incitements
to Virtue. Such Strokes of Morality, <i>Horace</i>,
particularly, is full of; and in <i>Juvenal</i> they occur
very frequently. Thus,</p>

Etymology of the Word Satire, I can't but think
their Opinion has more Probability in it than Truth;
nor can any sufficient Reason be assign'd, why it may
not be as well deriv'd from <i>Satyrus</i>, a Satyr, as from
<i>Satur</i>, full. There's certainly too much Reason to
think that some Things in <i>Horace</i>, <i>Juvenal</i>, and
<i>Persius</i>, were borrow'd from the suppos'd Manners
and Customs of Satyrs; and I cannot but lament,
that Writers so deserving in all other Respects, should
reprove some Vices in such a Manner, as to teach
them; and that while they are recommending Virtue,
they should throw in some Expressions so
injurious to it. This Controversy, then, about the
<i>Name</i> of <i>Satire</i>, (which, it must be own'd, is the
more material, because it in a great Measure defines
its <i>Nature</i>) I shall leave in Uncertainty, with <i>Vossius</i>,
rather than determine upon it positively with <i>Dacier</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">For I cannot but be surpriz'd to see this last Author
so confidently assert<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>,
"That <i>Satire</i> is a Species
of Poetry unknown to any but the <i>Romans</i>,
and has no Relation to the satirical Compositions
of the <i>Grecians</i>, as some learned Men, by Mistake,
have thought<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>.
 Now, I'll be bold to say, that
not only <i>some</i>, but <i>most</i>, if not all the Learned,
have thought so, and still think the same; and even Mons.
<i>Dacier</i> himself, I reckon among the Number, how
much soever he seems here to have forgot himself.
I appeal not only to what I have before said upon
this Subject myself, but to what I have cited from
him, whether it does not appear that the <i>Roman Satire</i>
had some <i>Affinity</i> with the <i>Grecian</i>, and, particularly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
that it ow'd its Rise to it.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
<i>Vossius</i>, speaking of the <i>Grecian</i>, tells us, "That the
Discourse was agreeable to the Characters of the Speakers; full
of Ribaldry, Ridicule, and Scurrility. The Failings
of Men were the Objects of their Scoffs, and to excite Laughter
the Aim of them. <i>Horace</i>, in his Art of Poetry,</p>

<p>Now will any one say, the <i>Grecian</i> and <i>Roman</i> Satire
had nothing of this in common between them? Are
Lasciviousness, Ridicule, and Banter, the exposing
Vice, and the exciting Laughter, Properties in
which the <i>Roman</i> Satire had no Share? We readily
grant, indeed, that as it appear'd in a <i>different Form</i>,
it was not the very <i>same Kind</i> of Poem with the
<i>Grecian</i>: But surely there was some, nay, a great
deal of Affinity between them; and the one, particularly,
owes its Rise to the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>Eighteenth Lecture.</i></b></div>

<p class="indent">Thus much for the Etymology, the
History of the Rise and Progress of Satire.
With Respect to the Nature and
different Species of it, I can by no means subscribe
to <i>Vossius</i>'s Opinion, who observes<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>,
"That, as the Vices of Mankind may be corrected either publickly,
or in private, the latter Method is much
the more suitable to Satire: And that <i>Juvenal</i> and
<i>Persius</i>, setting aside the Metre, have deviated
more from the true Nature of it, than <i>Lucian</i> in
his Dialogues, or <i>Julian</i> in his <i>Cæsars</i>. For the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
former shew their ill Nature more than their Wit,
and don't so much put Vice out of Countenance,
as themselves out of Temper; whereas the latter
always keep up their Humour, and mix their Reproof
with Facetiousness<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>.
According to this, the <i>Horatian</i> Satire is the only true one;
and the Writings of <i>Juvenal</i> and <i>Persius</i> have no Pretence
to that Title. But the truer State of the Case is
this: Satire in <i>general</i>, is a Poem design'd to reprove
the Vices and Follies of Mankind: It is twofold;
either the <i>jocose</i>, as that of <i>Horace</i>, or the
<i>serious</i>. like that of <i>Juvenal</i>. The former hidden,
the latter open. That generally makes Sport with Vice,
and exposes it to Ridicule: This probes it to the
Bottom, and puts it to Torture: And so far is it
from not deserving the Title of Satire, that, in my
Opinion, it is the more noble Species of it; and
the genteel Jokes of <i>Horace</i>, how ingenious soever,
are less affecting than the poetic Rage, and commendable
Zeal of <i>Juvenal</i>. I shall speak to both
Kinds, as <i>Persius</i> has well distinguish'd them, where
he describes the Difference between <i>Lucilius</i> and
<i>Horace</i>'s Way of Writing:</p>

<p><i>Vossius</i> still erring upon the same String, says, "It is
not so much the Business of Satire to reprove all
Sorts of Vice, as those that are the proper Subjects
of Laughter<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>.
 If this Maxim is true, <i>Juvenal</i>
will scarce find a Place among the Satirists:
For tho' he may sometimes laugh, he is, for the Generality,
serious; and shews the Lash much more
than his Teeth. Nay, his Smiles are very different
from those of <i>Horace</i>; they are not the genteel ones
of a Courtier, but mix'd with Gall and ill Nature;
such as <i>Virgil</i> describes:</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To whom <i>Mezentius</i> with malignant Smile.</span>

<p>The Argument which <i>Vossius</i> cites for his Opinion,
makes against it, rather than for it. He urges<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>,
"that those Vices are the proper Subjects of Satire,
that were so of the ancient Comedy: Hence <i>Horace</i>;</p>

<span class="i0">They shew'd the Man, and boldly told his Name.</span>
<span class="i40"><i>Creech.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>I ask, then, are Thieves, Whoremasters, and Robbers, guilty of those
less Crimes which are only to be expos'd to Ridicule?</p>

<p class="indent">But the same learned Writer goes on: "The
Diction of Satire, says he<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>,
ought to resemble Prose rather than Poetry, and appear with as
much Ease as if it flow'd <i>Extempore</i>. <i>Juvenal</i>
has had little Regard to this Rule, whose Style is
Epic<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>;
and <i>Persius</i> still less, who is swelling, and
lofty. Whereas nothing is so great an Ornament
to Satire, as an Appearance of Truth and
Simplicity, with which bold Metaphors are very
inconsistent." Here he takes for granted that there
is only one Kind of Satire, such as <i>Horace</i> writ;
which is begging a Question, that can by no means
be granted him. All he says may be very true, in
respect to that one Kind, but not at all applicable
to the rest; and to blame <i>Juvenal</i> for not writing in
the familiar Style, is the same Absurdity, as if he
should arbitrarily lay it down as an universal Rule,
that every Dramatic Piece ought to be writ so too;
and then very gravely tell us, <i>That</i> Sophocles <i>has
had little Regard to this Maxim</i>. For, to say the
Truth, there is scarce less Difference between the
two Kinds of Satire, than there is between Comedy
and Tragedy. But I cannot conceive what possess'd
this Writer, when, to prove his Position, that Satire
ought to be writ in the low Style, he urges this of <i>Horace</i><a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Non ego inornata, &amp; dominantia nomina</i> <span class="smcap">Solum</span>,</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Verbaque, Pisones, satyrorum scriptor amabo</i>."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You must not think that a satiric Style</span>
<span class="i0">Allows of scandalous and brutish Words.</span>
<span class="i34"><i>Roscom.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Here, says he, it is evident, that the Character of
a Satirist is not to affect Ornament, but Strength
and Propriety." Now, not to observe that <i>Horace</i>
is not speaking of the Satire of his own Time, but
of the satirical Drama that was us'd as an Interlude
in Tragedy; to pass by, I say, the Occasion of the
Words, the Sense of them is so far from favouring
the Opinion they are brought for, that they directly
overthrow it: He says, that in this Kind of Writing
he does not chuse <span class="smcap">ONLY</span> Words of common
Use, proving therefore that Satire may be writ in a
sublimer Style. <i>Vossius</i>, I suppose, here took
<i>non</i> for <i>nihilo</i><a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>.
</p>

<p class="indent">In the same Discourse he observes<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>,
"That it is the Business of the Satirist not so much to correct
the Manners of past Times, as of the present.
<i>Persius</i>, says he, often transgresses this Rule; for
he taxes few of his own Age, and those only under
general Names; such as <i>Titius</i>, or <i>Mævius</i>. His
Poems, therefore, scarce deserve to be call'd Satires,
because they affect no one particularly. And
<i>Juvenal</i> sometimes deviates from this indubitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Rule." I cannot help making a few Remarks on
these Assertions, which will not a little serve to illustrate
the Subject before us. In the first Place, I
can't see why it is the Business of a Satirist to correct
Mankind in Individuals, rather than in general. He
may chuse, indeed, either Way, and it is hard to say
which is more peculiarly his Province. But if any
Difference is to be made, I should take the Side
against <i>Vossius</i>, and avoid reproving Particulars. It
is undoubtedly fairer to aim our Shafts against the
Vice, rather than the Man. The latter, indeed, is
sometimes justifiable, against some notorious Monsters,
that deserve to be the Butts of Mankind: But
even here the Poet does not point them out by their
real Names, but under fictitious Characters; which
is another Particular I have been oblig'd to observe
against the foremention'd Author; who, for what
Reason I know not, makes it essential to Satire to
characterise by Name; a Property which I should
much rather leave to the Libeller, than the Poet.
<i>Horace</i> and <i>Juvenal</i>, it is true, sometimes assume
this Liberty; but, for the Generality, 'tis Vice they
reprove in the Abstract; and when they seem to
mention Names, it is to be observ'd, that we, at
this Distance of Time, know not whether they are
real or borrow'd ones. The other Observation of
<i>Vossius</i>'s, <i>That it is the Business of a Satirist not so
much to correct the Manners of past Times, as of the
present</i>, I readily assent to; and is so evident a Proposition,
that it is needless to assert it. The Living,
not the Dead, are capable of Amendment; the latter
are accidentally only, brought upon the Stage, that
the former, through their Sides, may receive the
more advantageous Wound. To this End, we often
see <i>Juvenal</i>'s Example follow'd:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Arraign them in the Persons of the Dead.</span>
<span class="i34"><i>Dryden.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>Which, by the Way, is a Confirmation of what we
before alledg'd against <i>Vossius</i>'s Opinion, <i>viz.</i>
That, in <i>Juvenal</i>'s at least, the Living ought to be noted
in Satire under their real Names. But it is Time
we should now return to the two different Species of
it which I before mention'd.</p>

<p class="indent">They both agree in being pungent and cutting;
yet are distinguish'd by very evident Marks: The
one is pleasant and facetious; the other angry and
austere: The one smiles; the other storms: The
Foibles of Mankind, are the Object of the one;
greater Crimes, of the other: The former is always
in the low Style; the latter generally in the Sublime:
That abounds with Wit only; this adds to the Salt
Bitterness and Acrimony. <i>Horace</i>'s Satires are of so
fine and delicate a Turn, as may much easier be conceiv'd,
than express'd: They are rightly term'd <i>Discourses</i>,
for some of them are scarce reducible under
either Species of Satire. <i>Juvenal</i>'s are all true Satires,
except the fifteenth, which is of uncertain Authority.
So far is <i>Vossius</i> from being in the right,
when he makes <i>Horace</i> almost the only Satirist, and
scarce admits <i>Juvenal</i> to the Title of one.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not very clear, then, why <i>Horace</i> should say
of himself,</p>

<p>But surely too much Warmth was never his Fault;
he ought sometimes, perhaps, to be condemn'd for
the Want of it.</p>

<p class="indent">Either Kind of Satire may be writ in the Dialogue
or Epistolary Manner, and we have Instances of
both Forms in <i>Horace</i>, <i>Juvenal</i>, and <i>Persius</i>.
As some of <i>Horace</i>'s, which are call'd Satires, are as
truly Epistles; so many of his Epistles might as well
be call'd Satires. For Example,<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a><i>Qui fit Mecænas</i>,

<p>What a Poignancy in the Words, and how swift a

<p class="indent">I agree with <i>Vossius</i>, but for a different
Reason from his, that <i>Persius</i> scarce deserves a Place among
the Satirists. He has dropp'd, indeed, many fine Expressions
in describing the Beauty of Virtue, and the
Deformity of Vice: But he wants Poignancy and
Sting; he never laughs, and strikes but seldom: He
does not correct Faults so much, as find them; his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Reproof, at best, is too mild, and more like the
Evenness of a <i>Philosopher</i>, than the
Severity of a <i>Satirist</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">To come now to our own Times. There
are few Kinds of Writing, in which the Moderns, of our
own Country especially, are less exceeded than in
this<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>;
I mean in that Species of it in which <i>Juvenal</i>
writ: For the <i>Horatian</i> Satire is but little affected
among us. That Author, particularly<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>,
who not long since attack'd the <i>Jesuits</i>, tho' his Works,
either through want of Care, or Judgment, or, more
probably, considering his Youth, for want of both,
are not so correct as might have been wish'd; yet his
shewn a true poetical Vein, and a Fire not unworthy
<i>Juvenal</i> himself. No one can be a Stranger to
<i>Dryden</i>, who, as he exceeds others in every Kind of
Poetry, so, in this, exceeds himself. But to pass by
the rest of our own Countrymen whom I might
mention, that deservedly celebrated <i>French</i>
Poet<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
has so happily blended <i>Horace</i> and <i>Juvenal</i> together,
that he seems to have found out a beautiful Species
of Satire between both. He claims the poetical
Laurel, but in Satire more particularly, from all the
Writers of this Age, by universal Consent; and that
is an Authority, to which I shall never think fit to oppose
my private Judgment, whatever it is.

<h2>LECTURE XIX, <i>&amp;c.</i><br />
<small><i>Of the</i> <span class="smcap">Drama</span> <i>in general</i>.</small></h2>
<hr class="r65" />

<p class="indent">We are come, at last, to that Species of
<i>Poetry</i> which is chiefly and primarily so call'd, because
it agrees best with the Sense of the original
Word, <b>poiein</b>, whence <i>Poema</i> is deriv'd. For
such is the comprehensive Signification of this Word, that
it denotes not only the Invention, but the Contexture
of the Fable, the Conduct of the Action, and
the Disposal of the Parts: All which concern the
two Sorts of Poems that now remain to be discours'd
of, <i>viz.</i> the Epic and Dramatic, but more especially
the latter. The former, indeed, is, upon the whole,
more noble in its Nature; but, in some Circumstances,
is inferior to the other; in the Action, particularly,
as the Etymology of the Word <i>Drama</i>,
from <b>dran</b>, to <i>act</i>, implies. In Epic, indeed,
Heroes and Gods are represented speaking: But the Poet
there performs only the Part of an Historian, and
the Speeches are no more than Narrations. Whereas,
in the Dramatic Writings, the Persons themselves
are introduced, every Thing is transacted
in our Sight, and our Eyes and Ears at once are
gratified. Now <i>Horace</i>'s Observation is undoubted just:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<i>Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Quam quæ sunt oculis commissa fidelibus.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But what we hear, moves less than what we see.</span>
<span class="i40"><i>Roscommon.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>Besides, the Action in the Drama is much more
simple, and compendious, than in the Epic; it takes
up less Time, and therefore requires more Art to
conduct it. It excites in the Mind more rapid Motions,
and consequently makes the Pleasure and Admiration
more intense. For these, and other Reasons,
<i>Aristotle</i>, in the last Chapter of his Book of
Poetry, does not scruple to give the Preference to
Tragedy before Epic. Not that I think he reckons
it a more noble Kind in <i>general</i>, (for that would be
contrary to Truth and Reason) but only so far as its
Sphere extends: And this is a Difference, which, I
humbly conceive, is very distinguishable. This Excellence
of the Drama, which I here speak of, is the
Reason, no doubt, why, tho' his Book bears the Title
of <i>Poetry</i> in general, yet he dwells solely upon
that Species of it. I am not ignorant, indeed, that
this Work of his, as it is now extant, is imperfect,
and part of it lost. But by what we have now remaining,
the rest of it appears to have been spent on
the same Subject. And <i>Horace</i>, the best Interpreter
of <i>Aristotle</i>, in his famous Epistle to the <i>Piso's</i>,
keeps chiefly in this Track. The other Kinds of
Poetry he does but lightly touch: But the Laws of
the Drama he treats of fully and professedly. After
his Example, various Writers upon the <i>Art of Poetry</i>
in different Ages and Languages, have chose to
dwell chiefly upon the <i>Drama</i>, and have left abundance
of elaborate Treaties upon that Subject. I shall
make it my Business to collect what others have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
said, into as short a Compass as I can, and explain
more fully what I have now to add of my own.</p>

<p class="indent">The principal Species of the Drama are two,
Comedy and Tragedy: Some others there are, of less
Note; as Pastoral, and Satire, both which we have
already spoke of. Tragi-Comedy I don't reckon
one of them, because I think it the greatest Absurdity
in Nature, and is not so properly a Species distinct
from the other two I first mention'd, as the
Abuse and Corruption of them. For what can be
more ridiculous, than, in the Compass of three Hours,
to distract the Mind with Joy and Grief, in such a
Manner, that the two contrary Passions may debilitate,
or totally extinguish each other? How ill are
such incoherent Parts united? And what is it but a
monstrous Production?</p>

<p>How irrational a Transition is it, from beholding
the Conflicts of Kings and Heroes with Misfortunes,
to descend, on a sudden, to low Scenes of Ribaldry,
and to return again from these to so moving a Spectacle!
A Poem, indeed, should be adorn'd with
Variety, but not with Inconsistencies. The Passions,
likewise, and Affections of the Mind, should
be bent and bow'd down; but so bent, that they may
not grow languid, but recover new Strength. This
poetic Kind of Prodigy, I think, is altogether modern,
and chiefly of <i>British</i> Extraction; for it was
the last Age produc'd Multitudes of them in our
own Tongue. I know very well that the learned
<i>Vossius</i><a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>,
speaking of the Plays of the Ancients
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
divided into <i>Prætextatæ</i> and <i>Togatæ</i>, observes, that
"there was a <i>mix'd</i> Kind, call'd <i>Tabernariæ</i>, where
some of the Persons appear'd in the <i>Prætexta</i>,
others in the <i>Toga</i>. Thus <i>Festus</i> in <i>Pomponius
Lætus</i>: <i>The</i> Togatæ <i>were of two kinds</i>, viz. <i>the</i>
Prætextatæ, <i>when the Actors represented Persons
of Quality, such as had the Liberty of wearing
the</i> Prætexta; <i>and the</i> Tabernariæ, <i>when Persons
of low Rank were mix'd with others of Birth and
Figure</i>. From hence it is plain, if the <i>Prætextatæ</i>
were a Sort of Tragedies, and the <i>Togatæ</i> Comedies;
the <i>Tabernariæ</i> being of a mix'd Nature,
were what <i>Plautus</i> calls Tragi-Comedies. Such is
the <i>Amphitryo</i> of <i>Plautus</i>, and <i>Hercules Licymnius</i>
of the <i>Greeks</i>." And as absurd as these Poems
were, they agreed so far, only, with our Tragi-Comedies,
that they mix'd Persons of high and low
Rank together; but they never debas'd the Misfortunes
of the former with the Lasciviousness of the
latter, as is usual with our Writers. As to the <i>Mimi</i>,
<i>Pantomimi</i>, the <i>Nomi</i>, and the <i>Attellani</i>,
they don't so much come within the Province of a Criticism
on Poetry, as of a History of it; since the Writings
of the Ancients, in this Way, are now quite out of
Date. They that are desirous of this Part of
Knowledge, may consult other Writers, and <i>Vossius</i>
particularly. But there's another Species of Dramatic
Folly, which the Ancients were utter Strangers
to, the <i>Opera</i>'s, I mean, introduc'd among us
from foreign Parts, by the mercenary Traffic of
Eunuchs and Courtezans: Among us, I say, and it is
with Shame I speak it, who set a Value upon every
Thing that is foreign; and are laugh'd at, on that
Account, by the very Foreigners we admire. Too
fatal an Indication this, of the Depravity of our
Taste, as well as of our Manners, when we place
the Height of our Pleasure in those Things, which it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
would be too much to honour, even with a Toleration.
Metre, no doubt, is very suitable to Poetry,
especially to the Dramatic Kind, and ought often to
be us'd there, as it is a proper Instrument of raising
or soothing the Passions: But that the whole Drama
should be Sing-Song, that the Actors should always appear</p>

<p>that the most insignificant Action, as well as the
deepest Passion, should be express'd in Tune; and
whether they send a Message, or read a Letter;
whether they quarrel, fight, kill, or are kill'd; whether
they laugh, or storm, or die; that this should
all be perform'd in Song, is somewhat more monstrous
than the Poets ever yet describ'd<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>.
Whatever Share of Poetry these Performances can pretend
to, is so wretchedly silly, that it does not deserve
our Notice. Those Words of <i>Horace</i> are
truly applicable to them, and in a more proper Sense,
than he was ever aware of:

<p>'Tis then for the Music, only, they are follow'd. My
sincere Wishes are, that Music may for ever flourish;
but by no Means at the Expulsion of Poetry,
whereas both Comedy and Tragedy seem, at present,
to have been banish'd our Country, and yielded up
the Stage to the <i>Opera</i>; I will farther add, if I may
say so much, with humble Submission to better
Judges, even Music itself, when join'd with these
empty Rhythms, seems too light and childish, and,
by the frequent Repetition of the same Sound, tiresome.
And tho' I readily grant, that the great Masters
of <i>Italy</i>, in former Ages, far exceeded ours;
yet we have now such Artists, as, from imitating
the immortal <i>Purcell</i>, are arriv'd to a greater Perfection
than any which <i>Italy</i>, <i>France</i>, or <i>Germany</i>
send us. For, you must know,</p>

<p>Having thus set aside these spurious Offsprings,
Comedy and Tragedy remain now to be discours'd of
distinctly, after I have first said something of what
relates to them in common, that is, to Dramatic
Poetry in general.</p>

<p class="indent">The History of the ancient Drama, both <i>Greek</i>
and <i>Roman</i>, as it does not come within my present
Design, I leave to be learnt from <i>Vossius</i>, and others.
I shall only lay before you the following Passage,
from his <i>Poetical Institutions</i>, which may serve for a
short View of it. <a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
The Drama, says he, owes its
Rise to Days of Festivity. For in ancient Times
'twas usual for Men, when they had collected in
the Fruits of the Earth, to meet together, that
they might sacrifice to the Deity, and unbend their
Minds from the Fatigues of the Harvest. Hence
arose two Sorts of Poetry; the one graver, in
Praise of the Gods; the other jocose, full of
Lampoon against one another. Under the former
Head we may reckon the <i>Dithyrambics</i> of
<i>Bacchus</i>, Hymns to the Gods, and Panegyrics upon
Heroes. Under the second <i>Iambics</i>, and <i>Phallic</i>
Verses. The first Essays were rough, and unpolished;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
but, by Degrees, the great Actions of Gods
and Heroes grew more numerous, and increas'd
into set Fables: So, in like manner, the jocose
Compositions began to come under proper Regulations.
Thus from the former Kind arose
Tragedy; from the latter, Satire, Comedy, and
Mimic." Thus he, agreeable to which, is <i>Virgil</i>,
in his <i>Georgics</i>:</p>

<p>For the same Reason, I shall pass over all the Apparatus
of the ancient <i>Drama</i>, of which the foremention'd
learned Author, and many others, have treated
fully; the Form, for Instance, and Ornaments of
the Theatre, the <i>Scene</i>, <i>Proscenium</i>,
<i>Pulpitum</i>, <i>Orchæstra</i>;
the Habits of the Actors, as the <i>Toga</i>, <i>Pallium</i>,
<i>Soccus</i>, <i>Cothurnus</i>, and many other Particulars
of the like Nature. I cannot help, indeed, making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
this one Remark, that the Mask of the Ancients has
been, to me, Matter of Astonishment. For can any
Thing in the World be more contradictory to Reason?
The great Aim of the Drama has always been,
to represent Nature herself, and conceal Art, as much
as possible: The Poet, therefore, thought it his Business
to draw the Characters of Men, as they really
were. Is it the Custom, then, I beseech you, either
for Kings and Heroes, on the one Hand, or the
Commonalty, on the other, to walk about with
Masks on? Why, then, do they appear with them,
upon the Stage? If it is the Excellence of the Poet
to counterfeit Nature, why are so much Pains
thrown away, to convince the Spectators, that what
they see is but an imperfect Copy of her. This Artifice
might do well enough in Puppet Shews: But
that the immortal Works of <i>Sophocles</i> and <i>Terence</i>
should be murdered with so monstrous a Device, is
perfectly amazing. Besides, (to omit the Impediment
they must be to the Actor's Speech) is it usual for
Men to preserve the same Countenance in all the
possible Variety of Circumstances? Why, then, must
they do so upon the Stage? Where are the different
Passions, of Joy or Sorrow, and the various Turns
of the Muscles that express them? At this Rate, indeed,
<i>Horace</i>'s Rule is preserv'd according to the
Letter, tho' very far from the Sense of it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let all the Parts agree, and be alike.</span>
<span class="i30"><i>Creech.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>I cannot help wondering, that <i>Horace</i>, and the rest
of the great Critics of <i>Greece</i> and <i>Rome</i>, should have
borne with this <i>Opprobrium</i> of the Theatre<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
How much better is it for the Persons to appear as they do
among us, with their own Face, and, to use our own
academical Term, each habited according to his <i>Degree</i>.
Nor am I perfectly satisfied with the Sock
and Buskin of the Ancients, tho' undoubtedly a less
Absurdity than the Mask; for we all know, that the
Commonalty did not, in Fact, wear the Sock, nor
the Nobility the Buskin; and why Actors should appear
only as Actors, I can see no Reason, since it is
the Business of the Poet to imitate Nature, and conceal
Art and Fiction as much as possible.</p>

<p class="indent">As I before determin'd to pass over the History,
and the Decoration of the Drama, so I had much
less Inclination to describe the musical Instruments
that were made use of in it; this is rather the Province
of Musicians and Antiquaries, than Poets or
Criticks. The various Kinds of Flutes, the <i>Tibicines</i>,
<i>Choraules</i>, <i>Pythaules</i>, &amp;c. are abundantly explain'd
by <i>Vossius</i>, whom we have often had Occasion to mention.</p>

<p class="indent">To come, then, at last, to the Subject that
properly concerns us: The Drama, I define to be,
<i>A Poem containing some certain Action, and representing</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
<i>a true picture of human Life, for the Delight and
Improvement of Mankind</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">A certain <i>Action</i> I say, in the singular,
because it ought to be but <i>one</i>; two do but distract the Minds
of the Audience, and create more Uneasiness than
Pleasure. In many, indeed, I may say most Tragedies,
as well as Comedies, but in Comedies more
particularly, two Actions seem to be carried on; but
they are often only seemingly two, not so in Reality.
One of them is so subservient to the other, so united,
and interwoven with it, that it must be reckon'd
rather a Part of the same, than a distinct Action.
Like a small River that branches out from a greater,
which returns to its first Channel, and is totally lost
in it. But in some Plays the Action is entirely one,
and tho' the other Kind may be justly admitted, nay,
often admir'd; yet this must be allow'd the more
excellent of the two; for it requires a much nicer
Art to excite Pleasure and Admiration by a proper
Conduct of one simple Tale, than from a Variety
of surprizing Incidents. Besides, when the Mind is
solicitous only about one Event, the Thoughts are
more close and compact, the Expectation more attentive,
the Concern more exquisite, and the Impressions
strike deeper than when it is distracted and
weaken'd between two different Prospects. Here,
therefore, <i>Horace</i>'s Rule is more <i>peculiarly</i> directed,
tho' propos'd by him in general:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>
&mdash;<i>Sit quod vis simplex duntaxat &amp; unum.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p class="space-below">True, indeed, it is, according to the Principles of
Nature, and Natural Philosophy, that all Things,
the more simple they are, and less compounded, are
the more perfect, and less subject to Change and
Corruption, to Vice and Error. This appears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
manifestly, from a Comparison between the Body and
Soul, the Creature and the Creator.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>Twentieth Lecture.</i></b></div>

<p class="indent">Tho' the Words, <i>Fable</i>, <i>Action</i>, and
<i>Design</i>, are frequently us'd indiscriminately,
they have each of them peculiar
and distinct Ideas. By the <i>Action</i> is meant some
Adventure of one or other of the principal Persons,
attended by a great and memorable Event. By the
<i>Fable</i>, or Plot, a Heap of Incidents, Episodes, and
Other Things, which are subservient to the carrying
on the Action, and bringing it to a Conclusion.
The <i>Design</i> is a particular Disposal of the several
Parts, so as they may be artfully interwoven, and
unfolded. What we call the <i>Distinction</i> of <i>Persons</i>
or <i>Characters</i>, the <i>Passions</i>, <i>Thought</i> and
<i>Diction</i>, are certain Adjuncts and Circumstances adhering
to the Persons represented. These Things, tho' of the
greatest Moment, and the chief Concern of the
Poet, which we shall treat of singly in their proper
Place, it shall suffice to have mention'd only at present;
because they don't so properly come under the
Head we are upon, of the <i>Drama</i> in <i>general</i>. When
we come to the distinct species of it, these will
then offer themselves very naturally.</p>

<p class="indent">I would now, however, observe, that those
general Precepts of <i>Horace</i> relate to the Drama, where
he speaks <i>first</i> of the <i>Passions</i>,
<i>Thought</i>, and <i>Diction</i>:</p>

<p>The subject Matter of this Kind of Poem, is call'd
the <i>Fable</i> tho' it is often grounded upon true History;
because the greatest Part of it is fabulous,
tho' the Fiction be intermix'd with Matter of Fact.
When it is not so, it ought to be styled rather a
<i>Dramatical History</i>, than <i>Drama</i>; of which Sort
are many of the Plays of our celebrated Countryman<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>,

<p class="indent">But often the Drama, properly so call'd, is built

many of our modern Tragedies, both <i>English</i> and
<i>French</i>, (for <i>Comedy</i> has rarely such a Foundation;
but is either rais'd from some private Fact, which,
tho' true, is below History; or from Fiction only;)
sometimes, indeed, it is built upon Fable, but such as
is common, and well known; as the <i>Trachiniæ</i> of
<i>Sophocles</i>, <i>Oedipus</i>, &amp;c. the Author disposing of the
Fable according to his own Fancy, and giving it a
new Appearance: According to that of <i>Horace</i>:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Sometimes it is built upon the Poet's Invention only,
who forms an entire Plot out of his own Head.
Most of the Ancients, both <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>,
form'd their Tragedies upon fabulous History; most
of the Moderns either upon true History, or upon
Fiction of their own Invention, or such as has been
borrow'd from Romances of later Writers; which
tho' they are fabulous, are not, however, trite and
vulgar, like several of the Ancients; as the <i>Medea</i>,
for Instance, <i>Hercules</i>, <i>Iphigenia</i>, and the like.</p>

<p class="indent">In the Foundation of the Drama, <i>Horace</i>'s Rule,
in the first Place, ought to be observ'd:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Follow Report, or feign coherent Things.</span>
<span class="i30"><i>Roscommon.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>If it is built either upon true or fabulous History, let
nothing be introduc'd contrary to the Notices we
have receiv'd from Fame or History, of the Persons
concern'd in it. For, in this Case, the Faith of the
one, and the Report of the other, would openly
contradict the Fiction. A noble Critic of ours<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>
has severely lash'd a certain Poet<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
for this Fault, <i>viz.</i> for representing <i>Hannibal</i> soft,
effeminate, and languishing in the Blandishments of Love; and
<i>Scipio</i> passionate, and head-strong. But if the whole is
Fiction, let it be Fiction according to Probability.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Let the Writer take care that the Parts don't disagree,
and contradict each other. Here, again, <i>Horace</i>'s
Maxim is of Force:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
<i>Si quid inexpertum scenæ committis, &amp; audes</i></span>

<span class="i0">If your bold Muse dare tread unbeaten Paths,</span>
<span class="i0">And bring new Characters upon the Stage,</span>
<span class="i0">Be sure you keep them up to their first Height.</span>
<span class="i31"><i>Roscommon.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">To <i>follow Fame</i> in an honest Sense,
and to form a good Poem out of History, requires much Art,
and no small Invention. But a Poet that works
wholly upon his own Stock, shews scarce less Art,
but certainly more Invention. The latter is, in my
Judgment, the more noble Task. As it is wholly
new, it is sure to afford more Pleasure to the Audience,
and Honour to the Writer: He may be
said, in some Sense, to <i>create</i> his Materials, and is,
therefore, in the most proper one, a <i>Poet</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">I am well aware, that what I have here advanc'd,
seems to contradict the following Opinion of <i>Horace</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">New Subjects are not easily explain'd,</span>
<span class="i0">And you had better chuse a well-known Theme,</span>
<span class="i0">Than trust to an Invention of your own.</span>
<span class="i30"><i>Roscom</i>.</span>
</div></div>

<p>But not to insist that the Authority of the best of
Poets and Criticks is not to supersede Reason and
Experience; it is to be observ'd, that dramatical Invention
has been much improv'd since the Times in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
which <i>Horace</i> writ: And had he seen some of our
late Tragedies, form'd upon Fiction only, he would,
perhaps, have retracted his Opinion. It is a difficult
Thing, I allow, <i>to express</i> <span class="smcap">Common</span> <i>Things in
a proper Manner</i>, that is, to change and heighten some
noted,<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>
stale Subject, so as to give it a new Appearance,
and make it the Writer's own; and the
Observation is of great Weight: But, all Things consider'd,
whether we regard the Difficulty or the Elegance,
the Judgment or Ingenuity of each Composition;
greater Glory seems to be due to him that
produces a new Plan of his own Invention, than
that changes, and gives new Life to an old one.</p>

<p class="indent">According to the modern Criticks, every regular
Play consists of three Unities, <i>viz.</i> of <i>Time</i>,
<i>Place</i>, and <i>Action</i>. I have already spoke of the last: The
first, I would observe, is very improperly styled an
<i>Unity</i>. <i>Place</i> and <i>Action</i> may admit of Number;
but <i>Time</i>, howsoever extended, does not cease to be
<i>one</i>, with Respect to the Action which is continu'd
by it. This Observation, I own, is but of little Moment,
since all that make use of the Term, sufficiently
understand the Meaning of it, however inaccurately express'd.</p>

<p class="indent">As to <i>Time</i>, <i>Aristotle</i>, and after him
the great <i>Vossius</i>, and others, will not allow it above the Compass
of one Day; for which Reason, the <i>Heautontimoroumenos</i>
of <i>Terence</i> is reckon'd faulty, because it
takes up an entire Day, and part of another. But if
we were to reduce Things to the greatest Exactness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
the Action of the Drama ought not to be longer
than Representation of it upon the Stage. This,
no doubt, would be the compleatest Rule, could it
be practis'd. But tho' it will rarely or never pass
for a Probability, that so great Events should fall out
in so short a Time, yet we ought to come as near to
this Maxim as we can. To see the Ten Years <i>Trojan</i>
War crowded into the narrow Limits of one
Tragedy, about three or four Hours long, appears,
at first View, not only improbable, but impossible,
and will be rejected by the Audience as a monstrous
Imposition on their Understanding.</p>

<p class="indent">The Unity of <i>Place</i> ought to be preserv'd,
for the same Reason I before alledg'd for the Unity of <i>Time</i>.
The one supposes the other; for if <i>Place</i> is varied,
<i>Time</i> must be so too. If the Action takes up but a
few Hours, it is impossible it should be carried on
in Places widely distant. On the other Hand, if it
is transacted partly at <i>London</i>, and partly at <i>Oxford</i>,
a few Hours will not be sufficient. But there's another
Reason, with Regard even to Place itself, why
this Rule, concerning the Unity of it, ought to be
observ'd. What an Absurdity is it, for a Spectator to
suppose himself one Minute at <i>Rome</i>, and the next at
<i>Paris</i>? We cannot but despise a Poet, who is such
a Bungler at Fiction, as, in a different Sense from
that of <i>Horace</i>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

&mdash;<i>Modo me Thebis, modo ponit Athenis.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now places me at <i>Athens</i>, now at <i>Thebes</i>.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">It is beyond the Power of any Magic to transport
us into different Places, not only at the same Time,
but even while we are in the same Place. The usual
Limits of the Drama are within the Compass of one
Town or City: This some think too great, others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
too narrow an Extent. Larger it certainly ought not
to be: Nor is this probably too large. For tho' it
may not seem very natural for the Audience to be
carried from one End of the City to the other; yet
it may be impossible, perhaps, to represent the Action
itself, and some other Circumstances attending it, in
less Compass; and, as we said before of Time, when
we cannot come up to Truth, it must suffice to come
as near to it as possible. For, as <i>Horace</i> says,
upon another Occasion,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>
<i>Est quadam prodire tenus, si non datur ultra.</i></span>

<span class="i0">What if of farther Progress you despair,</span>
<span class="i0">'Tis somewhat, surely, to have gone so far.</span>
<span class="i30"><i>Creech.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">However, they are much more in the
wrong, who confine the general Scene within one Room,
or Chamber; for it is ridiculous to suppose, that
Persons of most distant Circumstances should meet,
or Actions of the most different Kind be perform'd,
in the same Place, or in so narrow an one. Truth,
then, seems to lie, as it generally does, between both
Extremes; and one House, perhaps, may be said to be
the just Extent of the dramatical Scene. It ought
not to be of greater Extent, because Persons of all
Ranks and Qualities are, in Reality, contain'd under
one Roof, and Actions of all Kinds perform'd in
that Compass. It ought not to be of a narrower;
because the Spectators, whether they sit in the Pit,
or Boxes, may very easily conceive different Parts of
the same House represented in the Scenes, since the
Theatre is large enough to contain one House entire,
and both the Persons of the Drama, and the
Spectators themselves, may be suppos'd to move
from one Side of it to the other.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">These Unities of Action, Time, and Place, ought
very carefully to be observ'd. For tho' a Play, form'd
upon the most regular Plans, will gain but little Applause,
if it is destitute of the true poetic Spirit; so
will it deserve as little, how much soever it may be
set off with Decoration, if it offends against the
Rules of the Drama. The former, with all its Regularity,
is cold and lifeless; the latter, with all in
Brightness, absurd and ridiculous. Let Rules be first
the Basis of the Poem, and from a right Disposal of
these, let the Ornaments arise naturally, and with
Ease. Colouring in Painting, is, no doubt, an Excellence;
but we are not to be so studious of it, as
to neglect Proportion, and transgress the Laws of
Optics. Besides, great Judgment and Caution must
be us'd, that we don't adhere so close to one Rule,
as to violate another. <i>Horace</i>'s Observation
is here undoubtedly just:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<i>In vitium ducit culpæ fuga, si caret arte.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus Fear of Erring, join'd with want of Skill,</span>
<span class="i0">Is a most certain Way of erring still.</span>
<span class="i30"><i>Roscom.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>A Misfortune, which, in this Case, it is very difficult
to guard against.</p>

<p class="indent space-below">To these three Unities, as they are usually
reckon'd up, we may not improperly add a fourth: That
of <i>Character</i>, which I just mention'd before, but
now design to explain more fully. By a <i>Character</i>,
I understand, that Assemblage of Circumstances
which discriminates one Man from another; such as
Age, Fortune, Manners, and Inclination. In this
Respect, then, let each <i>Person</i> be <i>one</i> from
Beginning to the End. Not that he is always to betray
the same Sentiments, or one Passion; this would be
as absurd as it is tedious; but that he should never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
speak, nor act repugnant to his own <i>fundamental
Character</i>. An old or young Man, for Instance, a
King or Servant may, nay, ought, as Occasion
serves, to shew the common Passions of Joy or Sorrow.
But for an old Man to be introduced in the
first Act; and to appear a young one in the second,
is inverting Nature. Again, the Meek may sometimes
sally into a Warmth, and the Breast of the
Passionate be calm; a Change which often introduces
in the Drama very affecting Variety: But if
the natural <i>Disposition</i> of the former was to be represented
as boisterous, and that of the latter mild and
soft, they would both act out of Character, and contradict
their Persons. The Temper of a Man, I
own, is sometimes entirely chang'd; a vicious Disposition
may be reform'd, and a good one corrupted:
But this is a Change which cannot be wrought
in so short a Time as the Action of the Drama
takes up. It may be much doubted, therefore whether
the unravelling of the Plot in <i>Terence</i>'s <i>Adelphi</i>
is agreeable to Truth and Nature, where <i>Demea</i>,
from an old Miser, turns, of a sudden, profuse, and
lays aside his Moroseness, for Good-nature; and
<i>Micio</i>, who had hitherto liv'd single, and dreaded
the married State as the greatest of Sins, in his old

<p class="indent">The <i>English</i> Drama differs in nothing

<span class="i0">Some Things are acted, others only told;</span>

<span class="i30"><i>Roscom.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">We then have more Action, and less Narration,
than the Ancients, who, in this Particular, are imitated
in Tragedy, by the <i>French</i>, and most other Nations.
But if our <i>British</i> Writers may presume to
dissent from so great Authority, I would ask, Why
may not Ladies of the first Rank be suppos'd to speak
in Comedy; or Heroes sometimes combat, or even
die upon the Stage, in Tragedy? There's no Absurdity
in this; nothing contrary to Art or Nature;
often much conducive to Terror or Compassion.
No one, indeed, would bear to see <i>Atreus</i> represented
boiling human Flesh; it is too ghastly a Spectacle to
be expos'd to View; and, instead of Pity, or Terror,
would excite Detestation. For the same Reason,
<i>Medea</i>, killing her Sons, should not be exhibited.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
But there are still some images of Death less shocking,
which may be well adapted to the Stage. I own,
however, we are apt to introduce some Things publickly,
which had better have been sunk in Narration,
and some in Silence, if Regard were had to
the inviolable Rules of Modesty, Decency, and Virtue.
Upon the whole, then, the Ancients brought
too little into Action, and we too much.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon this Head, I would only observe
farther, that I have one Scruple remaining from these
Words, <i>incredulus odi</i>, in the Passage I above cited
from <i>Horace</i>. Things that are not at all <i>incredible</i>,
may, for several other Reasons, be improper to be
represented, tho' they may make a very becoming
Narration: And what exceeds all Belief, we shall no
more bear to hear, than behold. And even those
Instances which <i>Horace</i> mentions as improper to be
represented, have nothing <i>incredible</i> in them, but
upon <i>other Accounts</i> are not fit to be obtruded upon
the Spectators. The Answer to this Objection is,
that the Words <i>incredulus odi</i> are not to be taken separately,
but jointly. Of the Sights <i>Horace</i> mentions,
some are <i>odious</i>, others <i>incredible</i>; not <i>incredible</i>
in the <i>Nature of Things</i>, for they are suppos'd
to be Miracles exceeding all human Power; but
<i>incredible</i> in <i>theatrical Representation</i>. Such monstrous
Changes, as of <i>Progne</i> into a Bird; <i>Cadmus</i>
into a Serpent; are too gross to be impos'd upon
the Senses: They are Representations, therefore, not
so much <i>odious</i>, as <i>ridiculous</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">There is one Fault which almost all the
dramatic Writers, both Tragic and Comic, Ancient and Modern,
have fallen into; that, I mean, of introducing
a Person who has no other Business but to hold out
a Dialogue, and hear a Story. This, to omit other
Examples, is the Case, in two of <i>Terence</i>'s Comedies,
the <i>Andria</i>, and <i>Phormio</i>. In the former of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
which, <i>Sofia</i> is introduc'd, that <i>Simo</i> may lay before
him the whole Plot of the Play; afterwards we neither
see him, nor hear a Word of him more. In
the latter, <i>Davus</i> holds a Colloquy with <i>Geta</i>, only
to hear the Amours of <i>Phædria</i> and <i>Antipho</i>, which
he has nothing to do with: Then he goes off the
Stage, and never sets Foot upon it more: Whereas,
all that support a Dialogue of any Moment, ought,
in some Measure, to be interested in the Business of
the Play, from one End to the other. But these adventitious
Persons destroy the Beauty and Symmetry
of it; which ought not, like Gothick Buildings, to
be disfigur'd with Props and Buttresses, and other
superfluous Out-works; but form'd rather according
to the Rules of <i>ancient</i> Architecture, where all the
Columns, and several Parts of the Fabrick, mutually
support each other; where there's nothing but what
is necessary, nothing but what is beautiful; and the
whole therefore beautiful, because every Thing is necessary.</p>

<p class="indent">But farther; that all the Parts may rightly
cohere together, some Reason should appear, why each Person
goes out, and comes in. This is a Rule of great
Moment, tho' generally over-look'd; and yet there
is nothing in the whole Compass of the Drama, more
elegant, or more difficult; nothing in which Art and
Judgment are more nearly concern'd. <i>Exit</i> such an
one, says the Poet; <i>enter</i> another: But a Reason
may often be ask'd, both for one, and the other. It
is not enough to answer, it was necessary, for the
Author's main Design, that it should be so. The
Audience ought to be appriz'd of the Business for
which the several Persons come in, and go out, and
on what Account the Stay of any of them would
have been improper. With these Notices, every
Thing will appear to them easy and natural; but
Otherwise, forc'd, and inconsistent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
As a Play is divided into Acts, so are the Acts
into Scenes. The former the more ancient Division
of the two. The Act concludes, when the Stage is
left entirely empty; and a new one begins, as soon
as one or more Persons come on again; the intermediate
Time being taken up with Dancing or Music.
The Scene changes as every Actor comes in, or
goes out, according to the general Opinion; but in
mine, I think a Play had better be divided into Acts
only, without any Distinction of Scenes between
the Acts: For the Place, during one Act, is always
the same, and without intermission of Persons or
Discourse. Thus, I say, it is, in all Performances,
that are writ according to the true Rules of the
Drama. But if any one shall maintain, that the
Scene ought to change with every Actor's coming
in, or going out, I shall not contend much about it,
since it is a Dispute about Words, rather than
Things. This, however, is certain, that what we
call <i>broken</i> Scenes, ought to be totally avoided;
those, I mean, where, in one and the same Act, the
Play is disjointed, and the Stage, for some Time,
left vacant. To omit the innumerable Instances I
might give of this, among the Moderns, as well as
Ancients, I shall mention <i>Terence</i> only, and one only
of his Plays, the <i>Eunuch</i>. In the third Act, <i>Thais</i>,
<i>Thraso</i>, <i>Parmeno</i>, <i>Gnatho</i>, and <i>Pythias</i>,
make up the second Scene; and at the Conclusion of it they all
leave the Stage. In the third Scene <i>Chremes</i> appears
alone, and, for some Time, talks by himself;
at length, <i>Pythias</i> comes in to him, and, after a few
Speeches, both go out together: In the next Scene
enters <i>Antipho</i>, he again alone. In the first Scene
of the fourth Act <i>Dorias</i> comes in alone; she goes
out, and then comes <i>Phædria</i> alone. This incoherent
Connexion of the several Parts of a Play, is
not less disagreeable than it would be in Architecture.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
The different Parts of a Fabrick are to be
divided; but in an artful and commodious Manner.
The several Acts in a Play resemble the Wings of a
Building; but broken Scenes are like gaping, disjointed Walls.</p>

<p class="indent">This leads me naturally to say somewhat of
<i>Soliloquies</i>, too much in Use with <i>Terence</i>, and
others. They are not, indeed, totally to be rejected, but
very suitable to some sort of Matter, provided they
are sparingly us'd; particularly, they serve to unload
the Mind of too much Grief or Joy; but are of
more especial Use in Speeches of the deliberative
Kind. They are more adapted to Tragedy than
Comedy; for it is most natural for Men to converse
with themselves, when Matters of Moment
and Concern lie heavy upon their Minds<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>.
But <i>Terence</i> often introduces a Person, not to deliberate
about Difficulties, but to relate what has pass'd. In
which Case, the Narration must be made to the Audience,
or the Walls; and it is hard to say which of
the two is the more absurd Supposition.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Donatus</i>, speaking upon this Subject of
the Drama, lays it down for a Rule, as <i>Vossius</i> cites him,
that <i>no Person ought to go off the Stage, above five
Times</i>. And <i>Vossius</i><a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>
himself says, immediately after:
<i>That this Rule, tho' it holds good in Tragedy, where
the Persons, as they are grave, so are likewise few;
yet in Comedy is not always regarded</i>. No, say I,
nor ought it to be regarded, either in Tragedy, or
Comedy. And if I may be so bold as to dissent
from so great a Name as <i>Horace</i>, I cannot see the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
Reason of that Rule of his, pretty much to the same Purpose:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
&mdash;<i>Nec quarta loqui persona laboret.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And in one Scene no more than three shou'd speak.</span>
<span class="i30"><i>Roscommon.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>What should hinder, but every one may go in or
out above five, six, or even ten Times, either in
Tragedy, or Comedy, if he pleases? Or where's the
Impropriety of more than three Speakers upon the
Stage at once? There are Maxims that have no Foundation
in Truth, nor do they in the least promote
the Order of the Drama, or the Pleasure of the Audience.
They don't flow from the Nature of
Things, but only from the arbitrary Will of the Directors.
A Poet shackles himself to no Purpose,
with these Fetters; and only makes his Performance
appear stiff and lifeless, with the Severity of them.
He might with as much Reason prescribe to himself
the determinate Number of Lines his Play should
consist of. In all these Things a Writer is left to
his Liberty, and the only Rule that can be given
is, to observe none.</p>

<p class="indent">As little do I see the Reason of <i>Vossius</i>'s<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
Rule, in regard to the Number of Actors: <i>That there should
not be above fourteen</i>. To be sure there ought not
to be more; and, if we except the Mutes, concerning
whom there's no Occasion to lay down any
Rule, there ought not, perhaps, to be so many. But
for the Reasons I before mention'd, I cannot see
any for fixing a determinate Number. Every Thing
of this Nature is to be left entirely to the Discretion
of the writer.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor is there any Necessity, from the <i>Nature</i> of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
the <i>Thing</i>, that there should be just five Acts in a
Play, according to that of <i>Horace</i>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Five Acts are just the Measure of a Play.</span>
<span class="i30"><i>Rosc.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">After him, <i>Vossius</i>, and others, <i>In a Play
there are neither more nor less than Five Acts</i>. So, indeed, the
Ancients have determin'd, and Custom has prevail'd;
and this, no doubt, is a very proper Division; but
there's no Foundation for it in Nature, and even the
Acts are now, and always have been, of uncertain
Length. And <i>Vossius</i>, in the same Discourse<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>,
observes, <i>Some think a Play may consist only of four
Acts, provided it be of a proper Length, such as may
be seen with Pleasure, and understood with Ease.
And 'tis a Remark of</i> Lambinus<i>'s that</i> Tully, <i>and
some others of the Ancients, mention the third and
fourth as the last Act, without any Notice of the
fifth; so that the fourth may be understood the last.
Nay, in his first Epistle to his Brother</i> Quintus, <i>the
third seems to be the last Act. The Words are these</i>:
"Illud te ad extremum &amp; oro, &amp; hortor, ut tanquam
poetæ boni, &amp; actores industrii solent, sic
tu in extrema parte &amp; conclusione muneris, ac negotii
tui, diligentissimus sis; ut hic tertius annus
imperii tui, tanquam tertius actus, perfectissimus,
atque ornatissimus, fuisse videatur. <i>Lastly, I beg
and intreat you to exert yourself in the Conclusion of
your Office, as artful Poets, and good Actors use to
do; that so this third Year of your Command, may be
like the third Act of a Play, the most perfect and ornamental."
Unless</i> Tully <i>meant no more than that as
Poets have a chief Regard to the last Act, you should
have the same for your third Year; which is to you, your last Act.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent space-below">I can by no means agree with the
learned Author concerning the Distribution of the Business that
is to be perform'd in each Act; who delivers himself
in this Manner: "The first Act opens the Plot, but
not the Event of it; because it would afford less
Surprize, to be known before-hand. The second
brings on the Design into Action. The third raises
some Embarras. The fourth shews the Way by which
all Difficulties may be remov'd. The last artfully
removes them." I readily grant, the first Act
ought to <i>open the Plot</i>. But this may be partly done
in the second; nor is it necessary the <i>whole</i> of it
should be laid open in the first. The first, likewise,
as well as the second, may <i>produce it into Action</i>:
The second, as well as the third, may <i>raise an Embarras</i>;
and the fourth no less than the other two.
The fourth ought not openly to discover how <i>Difficulties
may be remov'd</i>, the Business, rather, of the
fifth, which does that, and somewhat more. In this
Case, then, (as I said before in another) Rules are arbitrarily
prescrib'd, without any Foundation in Nature;
but all these Things are to be dispos'd according
to the free Discretion of the Writer. Were it
otherwise, the Audience would, in some Measure,
know before-hand what they are to expect in every
Act. There's no Necessity that one or the other
Part of Action should be peculiar to this or that Act;
nor are any Rules requir'd about it, except those
which we are now coming to, that relate to what
are term'd <i>Protasis</i>, <i>Epitasis</i>, and <i>Catastrophe</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>Twenty-second Lecture.</i></b></div>

<p class="indent">The threefold Division of the
Drama, into <i>Protasis</i>, <i>Epitasis</i>, and
<i>Catastrophe</i>, or, as others, in the
Terms of <i>Aristotle</i>, to the very same Effect, into
<i>Prologue</i>, <i>Episode</i>, and <i>Exode</i>, seems very natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
and easy; tho' neither of these Divisions is peculiar to
any Act. By <i>Protasis</i> is meant that Part which is a
Narrative of what has pass'd, and an Introduction to
what is to follow: In the <i>Epitasis</i>, <i>Incidents</i> as they
are call'd by the Moderns, arise; all Things are in
Confusion, involv'd in Doubts and Difficulties; and
the Audience <i>anxious, and trembling for the Birth of
Fate</i>. The <i>Catastrophe</i> clears up every Thing; and is
nothing else but the Discovery, or winding up of the
Plot. But these Parts, as I said before, are not assignable
to any particular ones of the Drama:
There's no Necessity that all the <i>Protasis</i> should be
contain'd in the first Act. The <i>Catastrophe</i>, indeed,
has its peculiar Place; for it ought to be entirely
contain'd, not only in the last Act, but even in the
very Conclusion of it; and when the Plot is finish'd,
the Play should be so too. The <i>Epitasis</i> runs thro'
the whole, except the Beginning, and the Conclusion;
the former is taken up entirely with part of
the <i>Protasis</i>, or the whole of it; the latter with the
<i>Catastrophe</i>. 'Tis the <i>Epitasis</i>, then, that supports
the Weight and Burden of the Poem, upon which
the Crisis of the Action chiefly turns. It far exceeds,
therefore, the other two, in Extent; as it contains
all the Revolutions of Circumstances, the sudden
Changes, and surprizing Events, till, at length, we
come to the <i>Catastrophe</i>, the last, and most surprizing
Event of all.</p>

<p class="indent">If what we have now said is true, 'tis plain <i>Vossius</i>
has not given a right Account of this Matter. "Of
these Parts in Comedy, the <i>Protasis</i>, says he<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>,
is contain'd in the first Act, and sometimes, likewise,
in the second: The <i>Epitasis</i> in the second, sometimes
the third, and fourth, but very rarely any
Part of it in the fifth: The <i>Catastrophe</i> takes up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
sometimes the fourth Act, or Part of it, but always
the whole fifth, or almost the whole. From
whence it appears, that the Division of the <i>Greeks</i>,
into <i>Protasis</i>, <i>Epitasis</i>, <i>Catastrophe</i> and
<i>Choricus</i>, is a better one than that of the <i>Romans</i>
into five Acts: For the <i>Greek</i> Division distinguishes the
Drama into Parts that differ in <i>Nature</i>; whereas
the other Division into Acts, considers them only
as different in <i>Quantity</i>, without regard to any internal
Distinction." Now to pass over his mentioning
<i>Comedy</i>, whereas Tragedy is equally concern'd
in this Division, I allow it to be very true, that the
<i>Protasis</i> is contain'd in <i>the first Act, and sometimes in
the second likewise</i>; and I will add, sometimes in any
other Act; tho' this seems to contradict <i>Vossius</i>'s Opinion
in another Place, where he says, <i>The first Act
unfolds the Plot</i>, as if that was the peculiar Business
of the first Act. I grant, also, that the <i>Epitasis</i> is
contain'd in the second, the third, and fourth; but
let me add, likewise, partly in the first, and partly in
the fifth: For there's no Act to which the <i>Epitasis</i> is
not suitable; and I must be so bold as to deny, what
this learned Author asserts, that <i>there's rarely any
Part of it in the fifth</i>; so far is this from being
true, that some of it ought always to be in the fifth.
Nor do I grant <i>that the Catastrophe takes up sometimes
the fourth Act, or Part of it, but always the
whole fifth, or almost the whole</i>. For the <i>Catastrophe</i>
ought to turn, as we say, upon a Point, to start up,
on a sudden; as soon as that is discover'd, the Play
should conclude; and this End once obtain'd, all the
Action cease: Otherwise, the Curiosity of the Audience
will be pall'd, and what promis'd Pleasure,
will then appear insipid and tedious. Nor had <i>Vossius</i>
any good Reason to compare this Division of
<i>Protasis</i>, <i>Epitasis</i>, and <i>Catastrophe</i>, with that of five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Acts, as if these two Divisions were inconsistent<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>,
whereas, from what has been said, it appears, they are
very compatible, nay, I may say, include each other.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Scaliger</i><a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>
defines the Catastrophe to be a <i>Turn of
Affairs that were before embroil'd into an unexpected Calm</i>;
and <i>Evanthius</i>,(as <i>Vossius</i><a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
cites him) a <i>Turn of Affairs to a happy Conclusion, after the Audience
have been Witnesses to what has pass'd</i>. Both wrong:
For (as the same <i>Vossius</i> well observes) both Definitions
suit only a Comic Catastrophe, not a Dramatic
one in general. His own Definition is just, That <i>it
is the End of a Play, where Fortune is seen to terminate
in good or ill Success</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The great Care in the <i>Catastrophe</i> is,
that the clearing up of all Difficulties may appear wonderful,
and yet easy, simple, and natural. What <i>Cicero</i> says
of Friendship, is true of the Dramatic Fable, it is a
Knot that must be <i>untied</i>, not <i>cut</i>: And in such a
Manner, that tho' all admire the Event, yet, at the
same Time, are sensible within themselves, that the
Stream of Affairs could scarce have taken another
Course. This, I confess, is a difficult Task; indeed
nothing can be more so, than to raise our Astonishment
from the regular Effects of Nature. There
are, however, some Instances of this Art, that can
never be enough admir'd; among the modern Writers
especially, and no where more than among those
of our own Country; who, in the Conduct and Design
of the Drama, in my Opinion, leave the Ancients
very far behind them.</p>

<p class="indent">Another Thing the Poet should take Care of is,
to conceal the Event from the Audience till the Conclusion
of the Play. The Reason of this is so plain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
that I need not assign any. I cannot, therefore, but
wonder at the preposterous Artifice of some Writers,
who shew the Catastrophe of the Play, in the very Title
of it. We have an <i>English</i> Tragedy, truly excellent
in all other Respects, entitul'd, <i>Venice Preserv'd;
or the Plot discover'd</i>. How much better
would this have become the last Page, than the
first? Here one may apply the Words of a late ingenious
Poet of our own, tho' in a little different Sense<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Vestibulum ante ipsum, primoque in limine</i>, <span class="smcap">Finis</span></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Scribitur</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>Too soon, undoubtedly, for the Author's Reputation,
is <i>Venice preserv'd</i>; too soon <i>the Plot discover'd</i>,
for the Reader's Diversion.</p>

<p class="indent">To these three Parts of the Drama, <i>Scaliger</i> adds
a fourth; <i>viz.</i> the <i>Catastasis</i> which he defines to be<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>,
<i>The full Growth of the Fable, while Things are at a
Stand in that Confusion to which the Poet has brought
them</i>. But I can't see how this differs from <i>Epitasis</i>,
in which, according to his own Definition, <i>all Things
appear involv'd in Confusion, or Uncertainty</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">What the Moderns call <i>Incidents</i>, are such
Events as start up of a sudden in the Course of the <i>Drama</i>,
that are concomitant to the main Design, and conduce
to the bringing on the <i>Catastrophe</i> and yet are
not of so great Moment as to constitute distinct, or
even subordinate Actions. These are very serviceable
in exciting Admiration; and the nicest Art is
shewn in the proper Conduct of them to that Purpose.</p>

<p class="indent">There's one Fault, which both ancient and modern
Writers are often guilty of, <i>viz.</i> of introducing
entire Scenes, or the greatest Part of them, only that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
the Actors may have an Opportunity of making some
fine Speeches, and the Authors of shewing their
Wit; without contributing, in the least, to the main
Business of the Drama: Whereas, in Truth, no
Scene, of any Length, ought to be writ only for Decoration.
There may, nay, must be many ornamental
Parts; but no considerable one should be <i>nothing
else</i> but Ornament. As, in Architecture, sumptuous
Edifices are embellish'd with Entablatures, Relievo's,
and Sculpture; but no Part of them, of any
Bulk, or Weight, should be added, for nothing else
but Embellishment. The Reason is, because the
very Essence of Beauty consists in a genuine Simplicity;
such as Nature shews in the wonderful System of the Universe.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the Moderns, the chief, almost the
only Subject of Tragedy, as well as Comedy, is <i>Love</i>;
not so with the Ancients, who seem, in this Particular,
to have judg'd better than we do. For tho' it
must be allow'd <i>Love</i> is the most prevailing Passion
of human Nature, and the great Businesses of the
World, both public and private, are chiefly govern'd
by it; yet there are others, as Ambition, and Friendship,
to name no more, which may either singly, or
jointly, be the proper Subject of the Drama; tho' I
own its Progress would be much facilitated, if predominant
<i>Love</i> interven'd to accelerate the Springs
of Action. This Passion, like the <i>Primum Mobile</i> in
the ancient System, drives round the lesser Fires, as
so many Stars, within its own <i>Vortex</i>; and is, therefore,
by its active Power, far the most productive of
Thoughts, Words, and Events; and the best adapted
to excite Pleasure and Admiration. But, for that
Reason, as it is an Attempt the most difficult, so is it
the most noble, to please an Audience without this
Ingredient, which both the Ancients and Moderns
have sometimes very happily effected. All <i>Terence</i>'s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
Comedies are upon the Subject of Love; not so those
of <i>Aristophanes</i>: But, among the Moderns, I have
not seen one without it. Tragedies there are many,
absolutely free from it, especially ancient ones; as
those of <i>Sophocles</i>, and <i>Euripides</i>, which are adapted
to infuse Terror, rather than Compassion; and don't
so much aim at appearing soft and delicate, as grand
and magnificent. And among the Moderns, especially
our Countrymen, we have the Tragedies of
<i>Sejanus</i>, <i>Catiline</i>, and <i>Julius Cæsar</i>, to name no
more, who all meet their Fate without any Love to
hasten it. But the Poets of the present, and foregoing
Age, are full of Love, not only in their Tragedies
and Comedies, but in every other Composition:
That of <i>Terence</i>, tho' in a different Sense, may
be applied to each of them, <i>amore abundas</i>; they
<i>abound with Love</i>, or rather run over with it. But
more of this, perhaps, when we come to speak of
Tragedy and Comedy distinctly.</p>

<p class="indent">To the same Place I must likewise postpone,
what remains to be said of the <i>Chorus</i> of the Ancients,
for this, as I once before hinted, they added over
and above to the <i>Protasis</i>, <i>Epitasis</i>, and
<i>Catastrophe</i>. I pass it over here, because it is not,
like these I have now treated of, an essential Part of the Drama,
and is totally laid aside by the Moderns, in my Opinion
very deservedly. I shall, however, make some Observations
upon it, in a proper Place, since it made a
Part of the old Comedy, and was continu'd in all the
Tragedies of the Ancients.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor shall I here draw a Comparison between
the ancient dramatic Writers and the Moderns; this I
shall attempt in the distinct Dissertations that are to
follow. I would only observe, in a Word, that as
we have more bad Plays than they, so have we more
that are truly beautiful; they have fewer that deserve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Censure, and fewer that merit Praise; they more
correct, we strike out into brighter Excellencies.</p>

<p class="indent space-below">Thus much may suffice to explain the Definition
we at first laid down, of a dramatic Performance, except
what relates to the last Clause of it, that it is
form'd <i>for the Delight and Improvement of Mankind</i>.
Of the first, <i>viz.</i> <i>the Delight</i>, I have said enough
already: And as to <i>Improvement</i>, it ought to be the
End of all Poetry in general, but of the <i>Drama</i> more
particularly, whose Business it is to set before our
Eyes the different Courses of Life; the Virtues and
Vices, Happiness and Misery, that attend Mankind in
each of them. The Drama is so exact a Picture of
Human Life, that sometimes we are said to copy
That; according to that noted Saying, <i>Totus mundus
agit Histrioniam; The World is but a theatrical Entertainment</i>:
Which Comparison is beautifully carried
on by <i>Lucian</i> in his Dialogue, entituled, Χαρων, or Επισκοπαντεϛ.
It ought, therefore, to be an invariable
Rule, which is but sometimes follow'd, to direct the
Plot to some moral End, and upon winding up the
Catastrophe, to leave it upon the Audience with some
useful Precept. How little this has been observ'd, by
the Poets of the last and present Age, I am asham'd
to say; most of whose Writings, but Comedies in
particular, are so full of Filth and Obscenities, that,
far from serving the Cause of Virtue, they are the
very Panders of Lust and Impurities. I could wish
to see some Remedy applied to so great an Evil. In
the mean Time, let all good Men shun the Contagion;
and let not the Infamy of it fall upon Poetry
itself, but upon her impure Professors.

<h2>LECTURE XXIII, <i>&amp;c.</i><br /><small><i>Of</i> <span class="smcap">Comedy</span>.</small></h2>
<hr class="r65" />

<p class="indent">Having discours'd of the Nature and Genius
of the Drama in general; the three great
Unities, <i>viz</i>. of <i>Action</i>, <i>Time</i>,
and <i>Place</i>; the Variety
and Distinctness of the Characters; the Contrivance
and Management of the Plot, and other
Things of that Sort; Comedy comes next to be
consider'd separately, as it falls under the general
Rules of the <i>Drama</i> which are already mention'd,
and as it is distinguish'd from Tragedy, which shall
be treated of hereafter.</p>

<p class="indent">The Word <i>Comedy</i> is deriv'd from Κωμη,
<i>a Village</i>, and ωδη, <i>a Song</i>; because, consisting only
of a <i>Chorus</i>, and fram'd without Dialogue or Diversity of
Characters, it was sung originally in <i>Villages</i>, and was
therefore call'd a <i>Country Catch</i>; its first Appearance
being entirely different from that Dress, which
it afterwards assum'd, and still continues to wear:
Or it was call'd Comedy from <b>kômos</b> and <b>ôdê</b>, because
at Feasts (which were under the Care of the God
<i>Comus</i>) it was usually one Part of the Entertainment.</p>

<p class="indent">When or where <i>Comic</i> Poetry had its Original,
is a Question not to be determin'd, which <i>Aristotle</i>
accounts for in this Manner;<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
Αι μεν ουν τεϛ τραγωδιαϛ μεταβασειϛ, και δι' ὡν εγενοντο, ου λεληθασιν.

 <i>We are acquainted</i> (says he) <i>with the Alterations and Improvements
made in Tragedy, and with the Authors of them; but
Comedy, because less Regard was paid to it at first,
we know little or nothing of</i>. The Dignity of Tragic
Poetry was the Reason why the <i>Greeks</i> began to
improve it much earlier, and to take more Pains in
it, and therefore its Rise and Progress is much better
known. But altho' Tragedy was sooner refin'd, and
brought under the Rules of Art, yet it is probable,
that some rude Attempts in Comedy were more ancient:
Because it seems natural to imagine, that
Mankind, upon gathering in the Fruits of the Earth,
and receiving the other Blessings of Providence,
should be excited with Sentiments of Joy, affected
with an innocent Gaiety, and led on to some festival
Sports, before they could think of writing Poems
upon the Miseries and Misfortunes of other Men;
and because a Life plain, and without Shew, was more
ancient than State and Magnificence<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>.
</p>

<p class="indent">Before I divide my Subject, I shou'd now,
according to the Rules of Method, define it, which I
wou'd comply with, if the several Parts of it wou'd
properly fall under any one Definition, that wou'd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
equally extend to all of them. But as there were
three Sorts of Comedy, and the Definition, which I
propose to give, takes in only the two last and best
of them, which are now in Use, it may be proper
to observe, before I offer any Definition, that these
three Sorts of Comedy were the <i>Old</i>, the <i>Middle</i>,
and the <i>New</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>old</i> was of two Kinds, 1. There
was the very oldest of all, of which not the least Remains
are now left; but the Writers of it, as <i>Aristotle</i> tells
us, were <i>Epicharmus</i> and <i>Phormis</i>, <i>Sicilians</i>; and
<i>Crates</i> the <i>Athenian</i>. Their Performances were rough
and artless, innocent and sententious. 2. There
was, what we now more expresly call the <i>old</i> Comedy;
the Masters in which were <i>Eupolis</i> and <i>Cratinus</i>,
whose Works are lost, and <i>Aristophanes</i>, who
was the last in that Way of Writing. It was sharp,
and satirical, and extremely abusive; even Men of
the first Rank, whether the Facts were true or false,
if they were suspected only of any criminal Behaviour,
were brought upon the Stage without any
Disguise, call'd by their own Names, and us'd as severely
as possible. This is what <i>Horace</i> alludes to in
one of his Satires:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>Atque alii, quorum Com&oelig;dia prisca virorum est,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Si quis dignus erat describi, quod malus, aut fur,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Aut m&oelig;chus foret, aut sicarius, aut alioqui</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Famosus, multa cum libertate notabant.</i></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Cratin</i> and <i>Eupolis</i>, that lash'd the Age,</span>
<span class="i0">Those old Comedian Furies of the Stage;</span>
<span class="i0">If they were to describe a vile, unjust,</span>
<span class="i0">And cheating Knave, or scourge a lawless Lust,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or other Crimes; regardless of his Fame,</span>
<span class="i0">They shew'd the Man, and boldly told his Name.</span>
<span class="i34"><i>Creech.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Dignus erat describi</i>, deserv'd to be expos'd, <i>i. e.</i>
in the Poet's Opinion; for we are not to imagine, that
all Persons who underwent that theatrical Discipline,
did really deserve it: It is well known, how ill <i>Aristophanes</i>
us'd the very best of the <i>Athenians</i>, the almost
divine <i>Socrates</i>. Besides, it might, and probably
did often happen, that a Man who had in Justice
deserv'd Correction, might be too much a
Sufferer in the Measure of it. But, however, to
point its Satire in plain Terms against the greatest
Men, and the greatest Crimes, was a Liberty which
this old Comedy assum'd; an unreasonable Liberty
upon all Accounts, and not to be endur'd. For Men
of the first Rank, and Crimes of the blackest Die,
are not the proper Characters or Objects of Comedy,
as will be shewn more at large hereafter: And in writing
Satire directly to name Men, whatsoever Rank
they are of, is inconsistent with all the sober Rules
of Poetry: As, in the Comedy of the <i>Clouds</i>, <i>Aristophanes</i>
brings <i>Socrates</i> upon the Stage by Name,
as one of the Persons of the <i>Drama</i>. Indeed, this
Liberty of Abuse and Defamation, was allow'd chiefly
to the <i>Chorus</i>, and was most in Use during the Democracy
of the <i>Athenians</i>, especially in the Time of
the <i>Peloponnesian</i> War. But when the Thirty Tyrants
had seiz'd the Government, they thought proper
to make a Law against it. This <i>Horace</i> speaks
of, in his Art of Poetry:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Next these, old Comedy did please the Age,</span>
<span class="i0">But soon their Liberty was turn'd to Rage;</span>
<span class="i0">Such Rage, as Civil Pow'r was forc'd to tame,</span>

<span class="i0">Thus was the <i>Chorus</i> lost, their railing Muse</span>
<span class="i0">Grew silent, when forbidden to abuse.</span>
<span class="i31"><i>Creech.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">The most learned <i>Gerrard Vossius</i> has
oblig'd us with so good an Account of the Rise and Progress
of the two other Sorts of Comedy, I mentioned,
that I am capable of giving it no Improvements; it
is as follows: <a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>
The Government, for fear of being
too freely us'd, took away the Chorus, which
was generally extreamly abusive. Instead of it,
succeeded παρεκβασειϛ, or Digressions, which, like
the old <i>Chorus</i>, were Breaks in the Action, but
design'd chiefly to censure or expose the Poets:
If any other Persons were struck at, it was not
done rudely, but in a modest and decent Manner.
The Vices of all the Citizens, were, without Exception,
brought under the Lash, but no Body was
nam'd: Or if any particular Person was pointed at,
it was covertly, and in Disguise. And this Sort of
Comedy, after the third was invented, was call'd
the <i>Middle</i> Comedy; introduc'd between the Old
and New, but had a greater Resemblance with the
Old. The most celebrated Authors of this Middle
Comedy at <i>Athens</i>, were <i>Philiseus</i> and <i>Stephanus</i>;
as is mention'd in the <i>Prolegomena</i> to <i>Aristophanes</i>.
It was a Rule with them to name no
Body, but Gentlemen of their own Profession; a
Liberty which others were very willing to allow
them: In this, alone, they follow'd the Old Comedy,
which did the same Thing." Most, if not
all the modern Comedies, are of this Sort, except in
the last Particular, especially those of our own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
Country; as will be very evident, from what we
have to offer upon this Subject hereafter. Such,
then, was the <i>Middle</i> Comedy, and was succeeded by
the <i>New</i>, which we have the History of from the same Hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"Afterwards, in the Reign of <i>Alexander
the Great</i>, to expose the Vices of great Men, even
without naming them, was look'd upon as an Offence
to the Government. Comedy, by this
Means, entirely lost its ancient Privilege of Correction,
and a new Way of Writing was introduc'd,
to work up an imaginary Story, and instead
of <i>Chorus's</i>, or <i>Digressions</i>, to make Use of Prologues."
<i>Vossius</i> then gives us a long Account of
the Writers of this new Comedy, which we don't
think proper to repeat; and observes, "That <i>Menander</i>'s
Character was universally allow'd to be
superior to all of them. In these Comedies the
Liberty of Scandal, and all the Bitterness of Abuse,
was in great Measure laid aside: The <i>Chorus</i> (as
before observ'd) was entirely dropp'd, and the
new Invention, <i>Prologue</i>, now succeeded. Comedy,
at its first Appearance, was nothing else
but a <i>Chorus</i>; afterwards, Variety of Persons and
Characters were introduc'd, and the <i>Chorus</i> taken
away: So that it was first of all a <i>Chorus</i> only,
without Dialogue; and then Dialogue, without a
<i>Chorus</i>. This new Comedy differ'd very much
from the old; the Plots in the old Comedy were
chiefly taken from real Stories, in this always from
fictitious ones; that was abusive, this had its
pointed Satire, but no scandalous and unmannerly
Reflections. Nor were the Parts of it divided in
the same Manner, or into the same Number of
Acts. There was a great Variety of Measures in
the old Comedy, but only <i>Trochaic</i>, or <i>Iambic</i>, in
the new: And, lastly, the Style of this was more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
correct and elegant than the old, whose Language,
as it was more elevated, so was it less regular
and uniform." This new Comedy was the
only Sort that ever appear'd upon the <i>Roman</i> Stage,
introduc'd thither by <i>Livius Andronicus</i>, the Author
of Dramatic Poetry among the <i>Romans</i>. <i>Plautus</i>
and <i>Terence</i> proceeded upon the same Plan, especially
<i>Terence</i>; for <i>Plautus</i>'s Way of Writing has a
greater Resemblance of the <i>Middle</i> Comedy. And
therefore, tho' <i>Aristophanes</i>, considering when he
liv'd, and the Nature of his Poetry, was so much,
and so justly celebrated; yet, rejecting utterly the old
Comedy, the two last Sorts are such only as ought
to be included in the general Idea of Comic Poetry:
Or, perhaps, by uniting both the last together, a just
Notion of Comedy may be better form'd, which, I
think, may be defin'd in this Manner: <i>Comedy is a
Sort of Dramatic Poetry, which gives a View of common
and private Life, recommends Virtue, and exposes
the Vices and Follies of Mankind in a humorous and
merry Way of Writing</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">This Idea of Comedy, is what arises rather
from joining both Sorts together, than what properly belongs
to either of them: For neither, taken separately,
come up to it. Virtue had not its just Commendation
in the <i>Middle</i> Comedy, nor Vice its due
Correction in the <i>New</i>: There was too much Mirth
in one, and Gravity in the other. This, therefore,
is the Definition of a perfect Comedy, not as it <i>always</i>,
or indeed <i>generally is</i>, but as it is <i>sometimes</i>,
and <i>always ought</i> to be. "Comedy (says <i>Vossius</i>) is
divided by some <i>Greek</i> and <i>Roman</i> Criticks into the
<i>Moral</i> and the <i>Merry</i>: The first gives a natural
and sober View of common Life; the other is all
over Pleasantry and Ridicule." And this was undoubtedly
a very convenient Division, because it takes
the Case as it really is. Of the first Kind, are <i>Terence</i>'s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
Comedies, of the last <i>Plautus</i>'s: But both of them
had been more perfect, if they had fallen a little
more into each other's Way of Writing; if <i>Terence</i>
had endeavour'd more to make us laugh, and <i>Plautus</i>
to be more serious.</p>

<p class="indent">Comedy is defin'd by <i>Scaliger</i><a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>,
to be <i>a Dramatic Poem, representing the Business of Life,
whose Event is fortunate, and Style familiar</i>. But to represent
the Business of Life, belongs to the <i>Drama</i> in general,
and may equally be applied to Tragedy or Comedy;
and therefore ought not to make Part of the
distinguishing Character of either of them. Comedy,
indeed, ought always to end fortunately, and the
Style should be familiar: But both these are included
under that Branch of our Definition which says,
it must be <i>in a humorous or facetious Way of Writing</i>.
Mirth and Raillery, tho' essential to this Sort of Poetry,
are not taken Notice of in <i>Scaliger</i>'s Definition,
and, in <i>Vossius</i>'s Opinion<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>,
are not at all necessary in the Idea of it. But is it possible
to have any Notion of Comedy, where Mirth and Humour have no
Place in it? <i>Scaliger</i> says, in another Place<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>,
tho' not very consistently, that it was common, both in
Tragedy and Comedy, to have the Play sometimes
<i>conclude with a Mixture of Grief and Gladness</i>. He
seems to have forgot his own Definition of Comedy,
where he would have it always <i>end successfully</i>.
He mentions, indeed, many Comedies<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>,
<i>where there it a Mixture of Mirth and Sorrow in them</i>;
and the Observation might have been as true of all
the rest. For it is scarce, if at all possible, that all
the Persons concern'd in an Action should rejoice in
the most fortunate and successful Conclusion of it;
because, where-ever any Emulation or Competition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
rises, it is impossible that every Body should succeed:
And were it possible, it would be improper; for Vice
should always receive its Punishment, and Virtue its
Reward. It is therefore to no Purpose to give us
the Instances of <i>Thraso</i> in <i>Terence</i>'s <i>Eunuch</i>,
of <i>Chremes</i> in his <i>Phormio</i>, or of others, who at the
End of the Play go off in some Concern. For (not to observe
that their Sorrow is very much soften'd in the
Conclusion) to make the Event prosperous, it is
enough, that in general, and in the main Point, it
turns out successfully, and that all the Audience, tho'
not all the Persons concern'd in the Action, are dismiss'd
in good Humour. What <i>Scaliger</i> says of Tragedies,
(which we shall speak of hereafter) is very
true, that the <i>Catastrophe</i> neither is, nor always ought
to be unfortunate. But certainly a Comedy ought
always to end chearfully. And this may serve, by
way of Answer, to what <i>Vossius</i> has observ'd about the
double <i>Catastrophe</i> of some Comedies, which, with
regard to different Persons, <i>are joyful and unfortunate</i><a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>.
</p>

<p class="indent space-below"><i>Vossius</i> defines Comedy in this Manner,<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
<i>A Dramatic Poem, copying the Actions of the principal Citizens,
and common People, in a familiar Style, not without
Mirth and Raillery</i>. He therefore manifestly
contradicts<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
himself, when he affirms, afterwards,
that Mirth is not <i>essential to Comedy</i>. Having given
us this Definition, he proceeds thus: "But if we
consider Comedy, as it <i>has generally been</i> written,
we might call it, <i>a Representation not only of public,
but private Life</i>." Yes, truly, if we consider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
Comedy as it <i>ought to</i> be written, we may venture to
say, that it is a Copy of the Actions of <i>private Men</i>,
and not of the chief <i>Magistrates</i>. For by the Actions
of the <i>principal Citizens</i><a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>
he means (as it appears
plainly afterwards) those, who are concern'd in the
Government, and in the Administration of Public
Affairs, which are by no Means a proper Subject for Comedy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>Twenty-fourth Lecture.</i></b></div>

<p class="indent">But we said Comedy was a View
of <i>common and private Life</i>: Not
that the lower Sort of People only
are to be represented in it; for Gentlemen, and
even Nobility, not only may, but ought sometimes
to be introduc'd, if they do not appear in
a public Character; but by no Means Princes, or
Monarchs, or even Persons of lower Station in Government,
as concern'd in public Affairs; Circumstances
which are proper for Tragedy, not at all for
Comedy. Much less should a Deity be introduc'd;
for which Reason, <i>Aristophanes</i>, in his <i>Plutus</i>, and
<i>Plautus</i>, in his <i>Amphitryo</i>, break thro' the Rules of
Comic Poetry, by bringing <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Mercury</i>,
and other Deities, upon the Stage. There is, indeed,
as Comedy has been manag'd, two Sorts of it,
the <i>Genteel</i>, and the <i>Low</i>; the one consisting of Persons
of Character and inferior Life both together;
the other of the Vulgar only; and is not properly
Comedy, but Farce, nor so suitable to my Definition
of it. For this gives a View but of <i>one Side</i> of private
Life, and that the least creditable. Nor yet are
Persons of Condition only to be represented, because
we should still see but <i>one</i>, tho' the better Side
of Life; and because by this Means we should want
Mirth and Raillery, and the true Comic Spirit;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
which are all best kept up by Persons of low Degree,
or rather by a mix'd Conversation between those of
different Circumstances. Thus <i>Terence</i>, who, in <i>Cæsar</i>'s
Opinion, wanted somewhat of this <i>Vis Comica</i>,
would have had scarce any of it, if we had been entertain'd
only with the grave Appearance of his
<i>Chremeses</i> and <i>Simo's</i>, <i>Phædria's</i> and
<i>Antipho's</i>; and all the lower Characters of <i>Davus</i>,
<i>Parmeno</i>, or <i>Geta</i>, and such merry Fellows had been omitted.</p>

<p class="indent">An Image of common and private Life
takes in the Virtues, Vices, and Follies of Mankind; and
represents them in their true Colours; Virtue as amiable,
Vice as odious, and Folly as ridiculous. Nor
does this at all contradict their Definition of Comedy,
which <i>Aristotle</i> has given; where he seems to
determine, that whatsoever is truly valuable, and
worthy of Commendation, is by no means a proper
Subject for Comedy.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>
Ἡ δε κωμωδια, εστιν, ὡσπεσ ειπομεν, μιμησιϛ φαυλοτερων μεν,
ου μεντοι κατα πασαν κακιαν, αλλα του αισχρου εστι το γελοιον μοριον.
<i>Comedy, as we said, is an Imitation of the
worse Part of Mankind, but not thro' all the Enormities
of Vice; for it is only some Degree of it that is
ridiculous.</i> In this Definition, <i>Aristotle</i>, according to
his usual Manner, gives a short and succinct Account
of his Subject, not a full and perfect Explication
of it. And I may venture to say, that I have
offer'd nothing that is inconsistent with this Description,
by affirming that <i>Virtue</i>, as well as <i>Vice</i> and
<i>Folly</i>, is a proper Subject for Comedy. For when
he tells us, that the Characters in Comedy are to be
copied from the more ignominious Part of Mankind,
he does not say, they are to be copied from them
<i>only</i>: Nor does he mean, that none else are to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
represented in it, but that none else are to be <i>expos'd</i>,
and turn'd to <i>Ridicule</i>. And Vices will always appear
the more odious and ridiculous, when they
are plac'd in full Light against their opposite Virtues.</p>

<p class="indent">Mons. <i>Dacier</i>, who has given us a Translation,
and Notes upon this Part of <i>Aristotle</i>, affirms, that
<i>Ridicule is the only Subject of Comedy</i><a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>;
which is neither true in Fact, nor agreeable to his Author's
Meaning. I am sensible that the <i>chief</i> Business of
Comedy is Ridicule, but not the <i>only</i> one. <i>Aristotle</i>
intimates, indeed, what we not only grant, but contend
for, that great and scandalous Enormities, as
they raise some Degree of Horror in our Minds,
and are proper for Tragedy, are not so for Comic
Writers. But they may bring lesser Failings upon
the Stage, and perhaps some which are rather odious
than ridiculous: Nor does that great Philosopher advance
any Thing to the contrary: For in those Words,
αλλα του αισχρου εστι το γελοιον μοριον, he only
shews, what we readily allow, that the <i>chief</i> Subject
of Comedy is Ridicule: And he plainly insinuates,
that scandalous and great Crimes are not proper for
it, when he defines it <i>an Imitation of the worse Part
of Mankind, but not practising every Kind of Vice</i>.
And yet Mons. <i>Dacier</i> defends <i>Aristophanes</i>, and other
Writers of the old Comedy, who (as <i>Horace</i> observes,
in the Verses before mention'd) expos'd the
worst Sort of Crimes upon the Stage, tho' he insists,
at the same Time, that nothing is to be admitted in
Comedy, but what is the Subject of Ridicule. He
attempts, indeed, to reconcile their Practice with this
Opinion, by observing, that those old Poets painted
even the greatest Enormities in that Light which made
them rather ridiculous than detestable, and that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
Audience were to consider them only in that View:
But it is very evident, that horrid and abominable
Vices (such were some of those which <i>Horace</i> mentions,
and these Writers expos'd) as Murder, for
Instance, can by <i>no sort</i> of Colouring be ridiculous,
nor, in the Nature of Things, become the Object of
Jest and Merriment. I own there may be some Circumstances
attending the greatest Crimes, which may
excite rather Contempt or Laughter, than Horror or
Detestation, as may be observ'd in the Instances of
<i>Theft</i> and <i>Adultery</i>, which <i>Horace</i> mentions: Nor do
I deny, that, <i>in this View</i>, they may have a Place in
Comedy, provided they are but seldom, and with
great Caution, represented: Tho', notwithstanding
all the Caution that is possible, they had better be
omitted. For, upon <i>the whole</i>, all Things consider'd,
such Actions are shocking, and can never be so truly
ridiculous, as they are detestable. However, to let
them make the most of this Concession, it can never
be admitted as an Excuse for those Poets who
represent Things and Persons as ridiculous, which
are in no Respect whatever the Objects of Ridicule.
I mention Persons, as well as Things: For Mons.
<i>Dacier</i> defends <i>Plautus</i> for introducing Kings and
Gods upon the Stage in his <i>Amphitryo</i>, and yet, notwithstanding,
pronounces it to be true Comedy, for
this Reason, forsooth, because <i>the Subject</i> (says he) <i>in
itself tragical, is by the Poet turn'd into Ridicule</i>.
Which is so far from being a just Vindication of him,
that it is the very Fault he stands accus'd of. For
what is this, but inverting the very Nature of Things?
It is not <i>Poetry</i>, but <i>Buffoonry</i>; nor can the Author
of such Dramatic Performances be consider'd as a
<i>Poet</i>, but a <i>Droll</i>. Such Prodigies may possibly
occasion a Laugh among the Vulgar, who think nothing
<i>marvellous</i>, but what is <i>monstrous</i>; but Men of
Taste, and Judgment, will always treat them with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Contempt and Aversion. To return, then, from
Persons to Things. If we restrain Comedy from
meddling with enormous Vices, do we not seem to
contradict <i>Horace</i>'s Judgment, who says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><i>Great</i> Faults may, I own, but not the <i>greatest</i>:
<i>Follies</i> the greatest, if you will, and sometimes great
<i>Crimes</i>, which (as was observ'd before) may have
something ridiculous in the Manner of their Commission.
Nor did the Writers of the old Comedy
<i>always</i> expose the greatest Crimes, but Crimes of a
less Note, and Follies of the first Magnitude, and
are in <i>this Respect worthy of Imitation</i>. But notwithstanding
the ingenious and refin'd Observations
of the <i>French</i> Translator, <i>Aristotle</i>'s Rule will for ever
stand in Opposition to his Sentiments, and exclude
such abominable Characters from being introduc'd
in Comedy, under Pretence of exposing them.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p><i>What we laugh at, is only lesser Failings, some Immorality
that is not shocking, and attended with no fatal
Consequences: As, to use an obvious Instance, a ridiculous
Face is ugly, and ill-shap'd, but without any
Appearance of Calamity.</i>
</p><p>And is this Description of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Ridicule ever to be reconcil'd with the most heinous
Crimes, such as the Writers of the old Comedy
have sometimes expos'd? Do such black Offences
affect us with no Sorrow; are no fatal Consequences
occasion'd by them? I don't then plead the Practice
of these Poets against <i>Aristotle</i>'s Opinion, (which yet
is a Difficulty Mons. <i>Dacier</i> endeavours to guard against)
but from the Nature and Reason of the Thing
I arraign their Practice: Tho' were the Point to be
decided by Authority, I should always have a greater
Reverence for the Judgment of <i>Aristotle</i>, than the
Example of <i>Aristophanes</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Crimes, then, of this Stamp, can never agree
with Comedy; not that we are for running into the other
Extream, and asserting (as I observ'd before) that Ridicule
is the only, because it is the principal Subject
of it. <i>Inferior</i> Crimes, of the more <i>odious</i> Kind, may
properly enough be introduc'd upon that very Account,
because they are <i>odious</i>: Tho' those that are
equally odious, and ridiculous, are much more <i>proper</i>
for it; as Avarice, Arrogance, Superstition, and the
like. And others, of a different Turn, if represented
in private Life, may, nay, ought to be expos'd on
the Comic Stage, as Luxury, and the preposterous
Affectation of appearing great without a Fortune, provided
this is done in a merry Way, and the Humour
is not lost in the Discipline. But Murder, Rebellion,
ambitious Thirst of Power, and other Vices of that
Strain, belong only to Tragedy. But the <i>Follies</i> of
Mankind (as they are usually term'd) that are not so
much <i>Crimes</i>, as <i>Imperfections</i>, that offend against the
Rules of <i>Decency</i> rather than <i>Morality</i>, are <i>merely</i>,
and in <i>every View</i>, ridiculous; and, upon that Account,
furnish the <i>most proper</i> Matter for Comedy.</p>

<p class="indent">But here it is necessary to observe, that all
the Virtues, Vices, and Follies, we have been speaking of,
take in the Passions of every Kind: For it is a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
great Mistake to imagine that Comedy should be
from one End to the other, a continu'd Scene of
Gaiety and Mirth: Some Parts of it may be grave,
sententious, and even sorrowful. Nor will any one,
I believe, who is a Judge in this Way of Writing,
ever find Fault with <i>Terence</i>, who, in the <i>Andria</i>, (to
omit many other Passages) brings <i>Pamphilus</i> on the
Stage under all this Concern.</p>

<p>And tho' the Style of Comedy is generally familiar,
yet it is sometimes capable of the <i>Sublime</i>. So <i>Horace</i>
observes, in his Art of Poetry:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>

<span class="i0">And <i>Chremes</i> be allow'd to foam and rail.</span>
<span class="i30"><i>Roscom.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>Where Interpreters are of Opinion, that <i>Horace</i> alludes
to that Passage in the <i>Heautontimorumenos</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p class="blockquot">No! had you sprung out of my very Brain, as
they say <i>Pallas</i> did from <i>Jove</i>'s, I wou'd not
bear to see myself disgrac'd by your Debauches.</p>

<p class="indent">But there is a wide Difference between that
Distress, which prevails in Tragedy, and that which occasionally
appears in Comedy. The one is like a
Storm in Winter, which covers the Sky all over
with Clouds and Darkness, only a few transient
Gleams of Light interspers'd: The other is like a
Summer's Day, which is generally serene and bright,
and sometimes, tho' seldom, a little over-cast.</p>

<p class="indent">The whole Compass, then, of our Passions,
may be represented in Comedy, as well as Tragedy; but
in a <i>Manner</i> intirely different, on account of the
Difference of the Characters from which they arise.
For it is certainly true, on the one Hand, that the
Foundations of human Happiness and Misery, all
the Springs and Sources of our Affections, are, in the
main, the same, and common to all Mankind: But,
it is as evident, on the other, that every Man,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
according to his Station in Life, expresses those Affections
in a different Manner, and with peculiar
Images. Thus, in a human Body, the several Parts
are in all Men nearly the same; but the great Variety
in their Condition, Education, and Ways of
living, makes the same Variety in their Appearance
and gives a different Turn, even to their Countenance.
A Monarch may be as merry as any of his
Subjects; but how different is the Air of his Mirth,
from that jovial Rusticity with which the merry Peasant
overflows! A Shepherd, or Swain, may feel all
the Anguish and Distress of Love; but how unlike
are his Complaints to those which a Prince or Sultan
would pour out upon these Occasions! Nay, and
the lowest Part of Mankind are not without <i>Ambition</i>;
but how widely distant is it from the high and
boundless Views with which Monarchs are affected!</p>

<p class="indent">But tho' every Passion may be properly represented
in Comedy, yet the first Place must always be assign'd
to Ridicule; that should be, thro' the whole,
the prevailing Turn. But how difficult it is for an
Author to succeed in <i>just Ridicule</i>, is very obvious,
not only to them who have attempted it, but to every
Body who has duly consider'd this Way of Writing.
It is no easy Performance to rally the Follies of Mankind
in an agreeable Manner; and to <i>laugh with a
good Grace</i>, is no vulgar Attainment. But most of
the Moderns seem to be quite of another Opinion,
and think, that nothing is more easy, than to <i>make a
Man ridiculous</i>. And it must be own'd, that <i>Laughing</i>,
in their Way, is one of the easiest Things imaginable,
with whom a wry Face is a Joke, and every
Joke a certain Mark of Wit: But <i>Horace</i> and <i>Terence</i>
were unluckily of another Way of thinking
Our Witlings, whilst they divert themselves with the
Follies of others, expose their own; and the Laughter
they are so ready to raise, returns upon themselves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
But, to say the Truth, our present Taste for Ridicule
is itself ridiculous, and that not only in Comedy,
but many <i>other Compositions</i>, especially in <i>Prose</i>,
which have met with great Approbation from many;
with whom, to invert the Nature of Things, and
misrepresent with trivial Gestures, and low Mimickry,
is reckon'd a Proof of a great Genius. Sometimes,
indeed, there may be a great deal of Wit in
this Sort of Burlesque, in describing Heroes and
great Actions in ludicrous and low Images, and setting
off Trifles with the Air and Majesty of the Sublime:
But if this is coarsly done, the Composition
languid, and over-run with Foppery, nothing is more
nauseous. To trifle in a sprightly Manner, is exceeding
pleasant; but nothing more odious than an
affected Dulness, and being downright foolish:
Which is too often the Case with these Wits, who are
wonderfully pleas'd with their own most ingenious
Compositions; who are dealing perpetually in Ironies,
and making Sport (as they imagine) with others.
There is, indeed, a peculiar Beauty in an easy and
well-turn'd Irony, which these toothless Snarlers
know nothing of; but to utter a heavy and palpable
Falsity, under the Shew of it, is mere Stupidity.</p>

<p class="indent">It may be ask'd, Whether Writers,
who would professedly expose the Follies
and Vices of Mankind, ought to
make their Figures larger than the Originals, or describe
them exactly as they are, without Addition or
Improvement. Each Side of the Question is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
without its Authorities. <i>Plautus</i> is alledg'd in Favour
of the first Opinion, and <i>Terence</i> of the last. But
granting that <i>Aristophanes</i> and <i>Plautus</i>, among the
Ancients, and most of the modern Comic Writers,
have taken too much Liberty in this Point; yet it is
an allow'd Privilege to Poets, as well as Painters, not
to be confin'd, either in Panegyric, or Satire, to the
strict Rules of Truth. Such Heightnings are no
more than meer <i>Hyperboles</i>; nor do those write,
or these paint, <i>contrary</i> to Truth, but <i>above</i> it.
The Strokes must be daring and strong, if you
would draw Men, or Characters, to the Life: It is
not enough barely to draw the Outlines of Vice and
Folly, if you intend to make the one ridiculous, or
the other detestable; some Colourings must be added,
both by the Painter, and the Poet.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Prologues</i> were anciently made use of
only before Comedies; but with us they are equally suited to
them and Tragedy. They who have a Mind to
know the several Sorts of them, may consult <i>Vossius</i>.
The Ancients had no <i>Epilogue</i>, which is intirely modern,
and us'd in common both to Tragedy or Comedy.
<i>Terence</i>'s Prologues have no Wit, and very
little Fancy in them; which cannot be said of our
Prologues and Epilogues, full, as they often are, of
the most lively Entertainment.</p>

<p class="indent">They who wou'd be acquainted with the <i>Chorus</i>,
the <i>Cantica</i>, and the <i>Pantomimes</i> of the Ancients,
must consult <i>Vossius</i> and <i>Scaliger</i>, and such Writers:
For these Particulars belong rather to the History of
Poetry, than to any Branch of Critic. The Use of
them, especially the Pantomimes, was to relieve the
Audience, that it might not grow weary of the
Play: A Practice which can never be mention'd to
their Honour: For it is a certain Evidence of a bad
Taste, when an Audience cannot bear to sit out a
dramatic Entertainment, without being reliev'd by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
such low Diversions: But we have the less Reason to
wonder at this, who have seen in our own Time
and Nation, Rope and Ladder-Dancers, and other
wonderful Artists of that Class, not only admitted
upon the Stage, but (to our Shame be it spoken) receiv'd
there with the utmost Applause. The Age,
indeed, even of <i>Augustus</i>, fell into much the same
Depravity, which <i>Horace</i> thus rallies for it:</p>

<p>They, surely, must be of very low Genius, that
cannot be content with a Comedy, unless it is disgrac'd
with somewhat lower, a ridiculous Farce.</p>

<p class="indent">From what we have said of the Nature and Turn
of this Kind of Poem, that it is a Representation of
common and private Life; some Persons will, perhaps,
imagine it to be a Work of Amusement, compos'd
without much Difficulty, or Genius. But this
is so far from making it easier, that it increases the
Difficulty of writing it. Take <i>Horace</i>'s Opinion,</p>

<p>Nor yet do we, therefore, affirm in general, that Comedy

Tragedy, which was the Opinion of <i>Antiphanes</i>, a

Comic Poet, as <i>Vossius</i> tells us<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>,
whom the Reader may consult for the Arguments and Replies on both Sides.</p>

<p class="indent">The Language of Comedy is by that learned
Author<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>
consider'd in two Lights; in general, with regard
to its Elegance; and more particularly, as it relates
to the Stage. "As to Elegance, he says, that
the Language of <i>Aristophanes</i>, and other Writers
of the old <i>Greek</i> Comedy, was more correct and
beautiful than <i>Menander</i>'s and other Writers of
the new. Among the <i>Latins</i>, <i>Terence</i>, for Beauty,
and Purity of Style, is superior to all; <i>Plautus</i> is
honour'd but with the second Place, tho', in <i>Varro</i>'s

has been so indulgent to <i>Varro</i>'s Opinion, as to approve
of it<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>.
<i>Horace</i> thought very differently,
whose Sentiments of <i>Plautus</i> appear from the Verses
already quoted. He proceeds, "If we consider the
Language with regard to the <i>Drama</i>, it must be
suitable to the Subject, and not at all sublime; but,
on the contrary, easy and familiar, and not set off
with too many Ornaments." It is needless to say
more upon this Subject, because I have already observ'd,
in a former Lecture, that the Style of Comedy
is not properly poetical, but an elegant Kind of Prose.</p>

<p class="indent">The Names of the <i>Greek</i> Comic Poets have
been taken Notice of already. Among the <i>Romans</i>, the
most distinguish'd were two, whose Works are lost,
<i>Cæcilius</i>, and <i>Afranius</i>; and two, which we now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
have, <i>Plautus</i>, and <i>Terence</i>. <i>Horace</i> has
observ'd of them,</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Compar'd in Character, <i>Cæcilius</i>' Part</span>
<span class="i0">Is Gravity, and <i>Terence</i>'s is Art.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">The latter Part of this Observation is clear and obvious,
but what that Gravity was, in which <i>Cæcilius</i>
excell'd <i>Terence</i>, and which itself seems in him to
superabound, is difficult to guess. By <i>Art</i>, says <i>Acro</i>,
as <i>Vossius</i> quotes him, is meant, the Propriety of Language,
in which <i>Terence</i> was superior to all other
Poets. But I should rather think, as <i>Vossius</i> does, that
by <i>Art</i> is meant the Management and Disposition of
the Plot; in which he far excell'd <i>Plautus</i> also. In
Comedy, as the same learned Author observes, the
<i>Romans</i> are much inferior to the <i>Greeks</i>; and he cites
<i>Quintilian</i><a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>
in Support of his Opinion, who has deliver'd
his Thoughts of <i>Terence</i> with great Freedom.
<i>Miratus sæpius ego sum, qui tanta fuerit populi Romani
gravitas atque constantia, tantusque latinæ dictionis
amor, ut</i> Terentianis <i>fabulis capi potuerit; in
quibus tam pauci risus, usque adeo rara scommata, &amp;c.
Sed agnosco tempora: Vivebant tum Scipiones; Catonesque
erant in pretio: Et incrementa fiebant tum
temporis illius imperii. Moribus populi in voluptatem
prolabentibus, oratio facta est solutior.</i> "I have wonder'd,"
says he, (and I am no less surpriz'd at the
Man's wonderful Way of Thinking) "that the <i>Romans</i>
should have so much Gravity and Composure
in their Tempers, such a violent Affection
for the Elegancies of their own Language, as to be
fond of <i>Terence</i>'s Plays, where there is so little
Mirth, scarce a Joke to be found. But it was the
Turn of that Age: The <i>Scipio's</i>, and <i>Cato's</i>, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
their Men of Taste, and in high Esteem: They
were all Gravity, and their Thoughts ran only
upon Conquests, and Increase of Power. But as
the Morals of that People grew less severe, their
Writings had in them more Gaiety and Pleasure."
This is <i>Quintilian</i>'s Opinion, as partial, as it is severe.
The Verses which <i>Cæsar</i> wrote upon <i>Terence</i>, and
<i>Suetonius</i> has handed down to us, are so well known,
that it might be thought an unpardonable Omission,
when we are treating upon this Subject, to take no
Notice of them:</p>

<p>But granting that <i>Terence</i> was no way remarkable for
his Talent at Wit and Repartee, yet (with Submission
to so great a Judge) so sharp and severe a Censure
seems more than he deserves. For there are
many, and those of the best Taste, who are more
pleas'd with a Writer, that perpetually keeps up an
agreeable Smile, and an easy Chearfulness; than one,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
who is every now and then throwing them into Fits
of Laughter, and violent Emotions.</p>

<p class="indent">Our modern Comedy, as I observ'd before,
has a much greater Resemblance with what the Ancients
call'd the <i>Middle</i> Comedy, than either the <i>Old</i>, or
<i>New</i>. It is much graver, and less satirical than the
first, and has more delicate Touches of Wit and
Raillery than the last. <i>Terence</i> seems neither by Genius,
nor Inclination, to have had the least Turn for
the sharp and satirical Way of Writing: His Excellency
lies rather in copying the common Characters
of Human Nature, and drawing them in the exactest
Manner, and truest Light; than in painting any of
its Extravagancies, whether in Vice, or Folly. The
modern Comedies have certainly more Wit and Humour
in their Composition, than the ancient; more
Art in working up, and unravelling their Plots; and
a greater Variety of Persons concern'd in them: And
especially in genteel Comedy, our Characters have
more good Breeding, and Politeness; and even in
Low Life, our comical Figures are more ridiculous.
But then, on the other Hand, the Language of <i>Terence</i>
is more pure and correct, more expressive and
elegant than ours: He has drawn his Characters
more natural, and more accurately observ'd the Rules
of Art. But to give the Moderns an absolute Superiority
in this Way of Writing, they have nothing
more to do, than to prune and retrench some Excrescencies,
without studying for any further Improvements:
Let them abate of their Luxuriancy,
and the Business is done at once. Nay, they seem
to me already superior to them in all other Respects,
except (which I am asham'd to own) in that intire Regard to
Modesty which is preserv'd in all <i>Terence</i>'s Characters.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
If we compare the modern Comic Writers in the
several Parts of <i>Europe</i>, Mons. <i>Rapin</i> tells us, that
the <i>Spaniards</i> have one or two, but one, especially,
that is considerable; the <i>Italians</i> have none worth
taking Notice of. The Dispute, therefore, will lie
betwixt the <i>French</i> and us. And who has more Wit
and Humour, is more elegant in Style, or natural in
his Characters, than <i>Moliere</i>? Tho', in general, if we
are not too partial to our own Performances, we are
in this, as in all other Parts of Poetry, superior to the
<i>French</i>; but the Superiority is no where so disputable.</p>

<p class="indent">As to our <i>English</i> Comedies, which are
written in Prose, if any over-nice Critic questions whether they
can be justly reckon'd poetical Compositions, because
in the Definition of Poetry, which we have already
given, some Sort of Numbers are made essential
to it; the plain Answer is this: If we keep close
to the Terms of that Definition, our Comedies may
justly be consider'd as Poems, in every other
Respect but this: The Definition is form'd upon the
universal Practice of the Ancients, who are, and
ought to be our great Masters in this Art; and it is
more reasonable to continue, than alter it, in Compliance
with the Practice of modern Writers. But
the Question, whatever Way it is determin'd, is only
an idle Controversy about Words, and of very little
Moment: For the Verses of the ancient Comedies
differ'd so little from Prose, that the nicest Ear could
not always distinguish them: They had their proper
Measures, but so loose and uncertain, that it is often
difficult to determine which is the true Way of scanning
them: And in Comedy more regular and confin'd
Measures had been ridiculous. How inexcusable,
then, is the Practice of the <i>French</i> Poets, who
have written whole Comedies in Rhyme, and Heroic
Verse? Rhymes are ridiculous enough in Tragedy;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
but that an easy and familiar Conversation, such as
Comedy is suppos'd to be, should be all in Rhyme
and Epic Verse, has something in it so extravagantly
absurd, that I am surpriz'd a Nation, so remarkable
for Wit and good Sense, could bear with it.</p>

<p class="indent">The Source of those agreeable Reflections,
that Comedy supplies us with, is so obvious, that it needs
no Enquiry. Mirth is always pleasing, and so is a
lively Representation of Human Nature, of the Incidents
of common Life, and those Characters which
are every Day before us. Nor is the Cause of that
ill-natur'd Pleasure less easy to be assign'd, which
arises from Satire, and Ridicule: Every Body is so
civil to himself, as to suppose he is not the Person
aim'd at. Who, upon these Occasions, ever thinks
of <i>Horace</i>'s Observation?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Fool, change the Name, the Story's told of thee.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="space-below">The Images, then, of the Vices and Follies
of other Men, flatter that Pride, which is too natural to Mankind;
who are apt to think their own Characters
rais'd, by the Ruin of others: This is such a Pleasure
as we ought to be asham'd of. But some there
are, of a quite different Turn, who are as much delighted
with the Moral of the Play, the Success of
Virtue, and the Punishments or Disappointments
which Vice meets with in it: And others have no
Regard to any Character but the Poet's, are taken
only with the Turns of Wit, and the Genius of the
Writer. But <i>Errors</i> and <i>Imperfections</i> are the great
Source of Delight in all Dramatical Performances,
especially in Comedy, which has, in general, more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
Friends and Admirers than Tragedy: Because there
are few Persons of so great a Genius, or so refin'd a
Taste, as to be sensible of those generous and agreeable
Emotions, which arise from Tenderness, and
Compassion, and even Distress itself. Scenes of
Mirth are pleasing to every Imagination, those of
Sorrow only to a few. I can only wish, that these
different Passions which arise from the Gravity of
Tragedy, or the Gaiety of Comedy, were made useful
and instrumental to Virtue; and that our Theatres
were not more frequented for the Amusements they
supply us with, than for the Lessons of Morality and
good Sense instill'd in them.

<small><i>Of</i> <span class="smcap">Tragedy</span>.</small></h2>
<hr class="r65" />

<p class="indent">In discoursing upon the Drama in general, I have
already mention'd the Origin of Tragedy. The
Word is deriv'd from τραγοϛ, <i>a Goat</i>, and ωδη,
<i>a Song</i>: because a Goat was the Reward propos'd to
the Competitors in this Art; as <i>Horace</i> has plainly intimated:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The first Competitors in Tragic Strain,</span>
<span class="i0">When a poor Goat was all the Victor's Gain.</span>
</div></div>

<p>For they deserve no Regard, who would derive τραγωδια, as if it were τρυγωια,
from τρυξ, <i>the Lees of wine</i>; because the Actors, before <i>Æschylus</i>
invented the Use of Masks, discolour'd their Faces with Wine Lees. This Etymology is harsh, and
unnatural<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>;
the other is easy, and agreeable to the Rules of Analogy, without changing so much as one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
Letter, as the other does.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
Their Opinion, who think it was call'd τραγωδια, as if it were
τραχεια ωδη, a <i>rough Song</i>; has still less Countenance
from the Analogy of that Language, or the Nature of the
Poem. But it is not worth While to dwell upon these Trifles.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Aristotle</i>, whose Discourse on Poetry is
employ'd chiefly on this Subject, defines Tragedy in this
Manner,<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
</p>

<p>Εστιν ουν τραγωδια μιμησιϛ πραξεωϛ σπουδαιαϛ, και τελειαϛ, μεγεθοϛ εχουσηϛ,
ἡδυσμενω λογω, χωριϛ εκαστου των ειδων εν τοιϛ μορ ιοιϛ δρωντων, κα ου δι' επαγγελιαϛ,
αλλα δι' ελεουϛ, και φοβου, περαινουσα την των τοιουτων παθηματων καθαρσιν.</p>

<p><i>Tragedy is the Imitation of a serious, entire, and important Action, in an agreeable
Style, the different Sorts of which Style must be regularly varied in the several Parts;
and not by Narration, but by the Means of Terror and Pity purging the like Passions in us.</i></p>

<p>All I would observe of this Definition, at present, is, that there are two Parts
of it which want some Explication. The first is, χωριϛ εκαστου των ειδων εν τοιϛ μοριοιϛ δρωντων;
that is, says<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a><i>Vossius</i>,
"That the several Sorts of Style should not be mix'd together, but brought
in separately in their several Parts. For <i>Aristotle</i>
adds, immediately after, <i>Some Parts are perform'd
in Metre only, some with Music</i><a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>.
"This Clause, therefore, of the Definition, can belong only to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
ancient Tragedy, and not to our modern, which is
entirely without a Chorus. The other Difficulty is, in
ου δι επαγγλελιαϛ. <i>Vossius</i> and <i>Dacier</i> are
both of Opinion, that this Part of the Definition was added
for no other Reason, but to distinguish Tragedy from
Epic Poetry, which is form'd, not upon Action, but
Narration. But still there is a Doubt left, which
neither of them attempt to clear up: Must we,
therefore, exclude all Sort of Narration from Tragedy?
Has not <i>Horace</i>, and all the Poets and Critics
after him, made a proper Distinction between Things
represented and related in the Drama?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Some Things are acted, others only told.</span>
<span class="i34"><i>Roscom.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Answer to which Question, I think, is this;
That there is undoubtedly a Dramatic Narration, but
always related by some Persons in the Play, not by
the Poet himself, as in Epic Poetry; and this latter
Sort of Narration is what <i>Aristotle</i> meant in the
Definition before us. There is no Occasion to explain
the several Parts of it any further, since <i>Vossius</i> has
express'd the Substance more clearly, and fully, in the
following Definition.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>
<i>Tragedy is a Dramatic Poem,
imitating some great, but unfortunate Event, in a
grave and majestic Style</i>: To which, says he, if you
please, you may add, <i>to raise the Passions, and purge
the Mind from them</i>. All this is intelligible, and to
the Point: But I wonder this learned Writer should
think the last Clause rather not impertinent, than essential,
by that negligent Introduction, <i>that you may
add it if you please</i>; which, as <i>Dacier</i> observes with
great Judgment, is much the best Part of <i>Aristotle</i>'s
Definition, and deserves, of all others, to be most accurately
explain'd. He should also (as <i>Aristotle</i> has done)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
have particularly mention'd the two prevailing
Passions of <i>Pity</i> and <i>Terror</i>, which are the proper
Objects of Tragedy, and chiefly affected by it: And
further, in Imitation of the same great Author, the
Beauties of the Style should not have been intirely
forgot. I shall therefore, from these two Definitions,
endeavour to form a third, much clearer than <i>Aristotle</i>'s,
and more compleat than <i>Vossius</i>'s. <i>Tragedy is
a Dramatic Poem, imitating some great, but unfortunate
Event, in a grave, majestic, and entertaining
Style, to raise the Passions, especially those of Pity and
Terror, and to purge the Mind of them.</i></p>

<p class="indent">This Definition, expresly, or by Implication,
contains these several Parts; <i>the Argument, or the Subject
Matter, the Sentiments, the Language and Versification,
the Characters and Manners, and, lastly, the
Moral, or the propos'd Effect</i>. All which agree in
this, that they ought to be great and sublime; for
with Regard to all these, Tragedy is the noblest Kind
of Poetry, except one.</p>

<p class="indent">The Subject is always some serious and
important Event, as the Expulsion of a Tyrant, the Death
of a Hero, and the like; which Event turns, and depends
intirely upon some violent Passion, either good or
bad; as Ambition, Revenge, Friendship, and especially
Love, (for Love, as I have before observ'd, is
the chief Subject of the modern Drama, whether
Tragedy, or Comedy;) or else upon the divine Justice,
which gives either to Virtue, or Vice, or to
both at once, their proper Retributions. It is likewise
necessary, that the Manners, the Thoughts, the
Language, (for these are so nearly allied, that they
are much better consider'd jointly, than separately)
should be grave, sublime, and magnificent. Hence
<i>Horace</i>, in his Art of Poetry, after laying down Rules
for the Style of Comedy,

Tragedy is nearly allied to Epic Poetry, nay, often
superior to it, in the Choice of Words, and Majesty
of Expression." Which makes <i>Horace</i> say of it,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Or swell with noble Rage the Tragic Style.</span>
<span class="i33"><i>Ch. Carthy.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>Not that all the Persons in Tragedy are suppos'd to
speak with equal Dignity, which is as inconsistent
with the Nature of Things, as of Men; nor should
the Language of a Messenger, or a Nurse, be as
sublime as that of a Monarch, or a Deity: Tho' great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Care ought to be taken, that nothing mean or trifling
appear in these lower Characters, much less like Joke
or Repartee, (a Fault which modern Writers, especially
those of our own Country, are shamefully
guilty of) lest Tragedy should sink below itself. A
judicious Tragic Poet will be less concern'd at the
Hiss, than the Laugh of an Audience.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor should the highest Characters talk <i>always</i>
with equal Majesty, for that is as great an Absurdity;
much less should they fall into Expressions of Low
Life, improper for Tragedy, even when they are
talking about Things of no Moment: For even in
them there is a Sort of Dignity, inseparable from
Kings and Heroes. Mr. <i>Dryden</i>, therefore, has well
observ'd, that in <i>Seneca</i>'s <i>Hippolytus</i> the Poet very
judiciously makes <i>Theseus</i> order his Servants to open
the Door (a very familiar Circumstance) in pompous Words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Unbar the Portals of the Royal Dome.</span>
</div></div>

<p>In expressing Grief, when void of Anger, (for Anger
is insolent in all Circumstances, and in great Men always
swelling) the Style of Tragedy abates something
of its Majesty, and descends almost into the Ease and
Freedom, not of Comedy, (as<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>
<i>Vossius</i>, less accurately,
expresses it) but of familiar Conversation.
"Especially if Heroes are introduc'd fallen from the
Height of Fortune; whose Spirits are less rais'd,
and their Language, of Course, is less tragical."
As Anger, therefore, raises the Style of Comedy;
Sorrow sinks that of Tragedy: Both which <i>Horace</i>

<p>The Reason of which is too plain, to want Explication.
By <i>Sermo pedestris</i>, the Poet means a more
familiar Style, but without Meanness; not quite degenerating
into Prose, much less into what is vulgar,
rude, or scurrilous: Tho' plain, it should be elegant;
tho' humble, and complaining, yet graceful, and truly
poetical. The Thoughts may, and often ought to be
great, even when the Language is far otherwise. For
there is a Sort of majestic and heroical Humility;
and tho' Kings and Queens don't express their Grief
in pompous and sonorous Words, yet there is some
Difference betwixt theirs, and vulgar Sorrows. There
is the same Distinction of Style, as in the Habit of
Mourners. The Monarch may exchange his Purple
for Sable, yet, in his Behaviour, in his Looks, there
is such a Reserve of Majesty, as will easily distinguish
him from a private Person in the same Attire.</p>

<p class="indent">As we observ'd elsewhere, there were two
Sorts of Satire, the one of a lower Kind, and less confin'd;
the other of a graver and severer Turn, and more
sublime: So the former is suited to Comedy, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
latter to Tragedy: For it is the Business of the one
to ridicule the Follies of Mankind, and of the other
to lash Vices, and Crimes of a deeper Dye. Hence
<i>Juvenal</i>, a Writer of the sublimer Kind of Satire,
seems to propose the Tragic Style for his Imitation.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Nor is it less the Province of Tragedy to improve
Virtue, than correct, and expose Vice; Virtue, I say,
and that heroic too: For Tragedy is a Sort of heroic
Drama; no Kind of Poetry is more sacred; none,
to which the noblest and best Sentiments are so suitable;
none, in which more exalted Precepts of Virtue
are, or, at least, may be deliver'd.</p>

<p class="indent">Tragedy, therefore, is, in all Respects,
adapted to the Sublime: But if it should be ask'd, how I can
reconcile this to Nature, that Men, of what Quality
and Rank soever, should be suppos'd, in their private
and common Conversation, to make such solemn
Speeches, of so much Art and Elegance;
when, in Fact, they rarely, if ever, talk in such
Language: I must ingenuously own, that this Objection
lies stronger against those Poems in which
Actions are represented, than in which they are barely
describ'd; and therefore, in this Respect, Tragedy
must give Place to Epic. It may be observ'd, however,
that even in Comedy, (which is suppos'd to be
less concern'd in this Objection) it is impossible to
imagine, that Persons should really support a Conversation,
as they are represented to do, upon the
Stage, and that it is full as natural to ascribe this Sublimity
of Style to Kings and Heroes, as those smart
Repartees, and fine Turns of Wit, to Persons of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
inferior Rank. But, upon the whole, the true Apology
to be made for both, is, that these are <i>probable</i>
Circumstances, if not <i>true ones</i>: It is enough, if they
bear a near Resemblance to Truth, or if, as <i>Horace</i>
has well express'd it,</p>

allow'd to go beyond the Life: Nay, this is the very
Point that shews their Skill most. When these imaginary
Touches affect as strongly as real Truths; if
we can be agreeably deceiv'd, even in spite of Conviction,
how great is the Art, and how just the Triumph
of the Deceiver? And this is what <i>Horace</i>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>Twenty-seventh Lecture.</i></b></div>

<p class="indent">But I must just take Notice,
that what we have advanc'd concerning
the Sublimity of this Drama, is applicable
to all Tragedies, but not equally to all.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
For as (what I have before observ'd) there are two
Sorts of Comedies; the one taken from Characters
of a higher Rank, the other perfectly low: So there
are two Sorts of Tragedies, the one quite sublime,
the other of a more humble Nature; the first representing
Kings and Heroes, and the latter, Men of
private Life, but of considerable Character and Station
in it. This, indeed, is intirely modern; the
Punishments or Misfortunes of Tyrants, and Princes,
being the only Subjects of the ancient Tragedy. We
said, that tho' it is form'd upon the Calamities of
private Men, yet of such whose Authority and
Station in Life make them considerable; because,
tho' the Afflictions of common People afford Matter
for Compassion, yet not for Tragedy, their Fortunes,
and their Manners, being far below the
Spirit of this Sort of Poetry, and the Dignity of its
Style and Versification. Some of the best Performances
of our own Writers, are of this Sort,
affecting us not so much with Terror, as Compassion;
in exciting which, the Moderns seem far superior
to the Ancients.</p>

<p class="indent">Tragedies, likewise, admit of another Distinction,
with Regard to their Event, either fortunate, or unfortunate.
It is sufficient to be true Tragedy, that
Incidents of Distress and Sorrow are carried on thro'
the whole, tho' the principal Persons come off fortunately
at last: I say, the <i>principal Persons</i>; because
even in this Species, that ends happily, it is necessary
that some Characters should be unhappy in the
Conclusion, especially the worst, or rather they only.
For I can by no means approve of those Tragedies
of ours, in which Persons of equal Innocence and
Virtue, of the same Rank and Eminence, are punish'd
and rewarded promiscuously. It is so, I own,
in human Life; but a single Dramatic Piece is not
design'd to give us an intire View of it: Let it therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
be truly one, and entirely consistent. It may,
indeed, very justly leave the best, and most distinguish'd
Characters, in Distress at last; which (as shall
be observ'd hereafter) is the most affecting Sort of
Tragedy. But if <i>some</i> innocent and virtuous Persons
are fortunate, let them be <i>all so</i>, and the bad only
left miserable; otherwise the Drama will be inconsistent:
And these opposite Agitations of Mind will
weaken and destroy each other. Let the Audience
go home either in a pleasant or melancholy Humour;
if you attempt both, you succeed in neither.</p>

<p class="indent">But to return to the twofold Division,
we observ'd, of this species of the Drama. "In Tragedies
(says<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>
<i>Vossius</i>) that are truly tragical, the
first Scenes are usually more sedate, and the last
dreadful. Thus, what a terrible Conclusion has
the <i>Ph&oelig;nissæ</i> of <i>Euripides</i>, where <i>Oedipus</i>,
with his Eyes put out, is by <i>Creon</i> banish'd from <i>Thebes</i>,
of which he had once been King? So, again, in his
<i>Hecuba</i>, we see <i>Polymestor</i> in the same Distress;
<i>Hecuba</i> bewailing the Murder of her Son, and the
blind <i>Polymestor</i> relating the Calamities which the
Oracle had denounc'd against <i>Hecuba</i>, <i>Agamemnon,</i>
and <i>Cassandra</i>.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>
But if <i>Orestes</i> and <i>Ægisthus,</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
who were determin'd Enemies, had been reconcil'd,
and parted without Blood-shed, the Tragedy
had been less perfect. For, as we observ'd, Tragedy,
in this respect, differs from Comedy, because
this always ends happily, the other generally
unhappily. <i>And such should be the Conclusion of a
Tragedy, according to the Rules of Art; but sometimes
an unexpected Happiness arises from the greatest
Distress: when this is the Case, the Poet departs
from the Rules of Art, in Compliance with the Taste
of his Audience, who had rather go home chearful,
than melancholy.</i> In the <i>Electra</i>, both of <i>Sophocles</i>
and <i>Euripides</i>, the Plot takes this prosperous
Turn, tho' <i>Sophocles</i> has shewn much greater Skill
in the Conduct of it. <i>Sophocles</i>'s <i>Philoctetes</i> in
<i>Lemnus</i>, concludes in the same Way; as does <i>Euripides</i>'s
<i>Iphigenia</i> in <i>Aulis</i>; his <i>Iphigenia</i> in <i>Tauri</i>;
and <i>Alcestis</i>; where, by <i>Hercules</i>'s Assistance,
<i>Admetus</i> has his Wife restor'd. And so his <i>Orestes</i>;
for when <i>Pylades</i> and <i>Orestes</i>, incens'd at <i>Menelaus</i>,
because he would not assist them against <i>Tyndarus</i>,
had determin'd to put <i>Helena</i>, and his
Daughter <i>Hermione</i>, to Death; <i>Helena,</i> by the
Favour of the Gods, is taken up into Heaven,
and <i>Hermione</i> (<i>Menelaus</i> coming first to her Relief,
and <i>Apollo</i> interposing, to end the Controversy)
is, by the Direction of that God, married
to <i>Orestes</i>, who now expiated from his Mother's
Blood, is made King of <i>Argos</i>. And his <i>Helena</i>
again, concludes happily; where she, having artfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
escap'd from <i>Theoclymenus</i>, returns to her
Husband <i>Menelaus</i>, and sails, with a prosperous
Gale, into <i>Greece</i>. So, likewise, his Tragedies of
<i>Hippolytus</i>, <i>Rhosus</i>, and <i>Ion</i>. Even <i>Ezekiel</i>, the
<i>Jewish</i> Tragic Poet, (as <i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i>
calls him, <i>Strom</i>. Book I.) was the Author of a
Drama, which he entituled, Εζαγωγη, or the <i>bringing
out</i>; from whence <i>Eusebius</i> has transcrib'd no
small Part into his <i>Evang. Præp.</i> Book IX. Chap.
IV. And what Event could be more joyful, than
the bringing that People out of <i>Ægypt</i>? <i>Nor does
Tragedy lose its Name</i>, (as <i>Vossius</i> further observes)
<i>tho' the Conclusion is fortunate; because a melancholy
Catastrophe is no Part of its Essence. Otherwise
great Part of the Tragedies of</i> Euripides, <i>that
are come to our Hands, would cease to be Tragedies.
Wherefore, in Respect to the Essence of this Poem, it
is sufficient, if it has upon the whole the real Appearance
of Distress.</i> So that the distinguishing
Property of it may appear, in representing the
doubtful and disastrous Fortunes of great Men.
Tho' I cannot deny, (says he) but that such Tragedies
borrow something from the Nature of Comedy.
For the Nature of Tragedy is to be
mournful, which is undeniable, since Terror and
Commiseration are the chief Ends propos'd by it.
When it is otherwise, it is only, as we said, in
Compliance with the Taste of the People. Hence
<i>Aristotle</i> says, that Poets fall into this Way of Writing,
δια το των θεανρον ασθενειαν that is, to humour
the wrong or weak Judgment of an Audience.
But as the Populace are mutable, and inconstant,
sometimes approving one Thing, sometimes another;
the best Way is to keep close to the Nature
of Tragedy, and not without great Necessity to depart from it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Thus that great Man, whose Sentiments I
should entirely approve of, if they did not seem, in one
Particular, a little inconsistent. He says, it is not
essential to Tragedies to end unhappily, which is certainly
true; and yet is of Opinion, that such as do
not end so, borrow something from the Turn of
Comedy, because the very Nature of Tragedy is
mournful. If by Nature he means the most distinguishing
Property, his Opinion is, indeed, indisputable,
but his Consequence is not just; because (as
appears already, from both our Dissertations upon
this Subject) Sorrow may be the prevailing Passion
in a Drama, which, nevertheless, may conclude successfully.
For every Scene of it, from the first to
the last, may supply us with proper Objects of Terror
and Compassion. If by Nature <i>Vossius</i> understands
the whole Essence of Tragedy, he is not only
mistaken, but plainly contradicts<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
himself; as appears from the Passages already quoted. The best
Way, therefore, of determining this Point, seems to
be, that <i>both</i> these Sorts are <i>true Tragedies</i>,
but the one <i>more tragical</i> than the other.</p>

<p class="indent">However, that which is least tragical,
and ends happily, requires more Art to write, and is read
with more Advantage. With Regard to the first Particular,
I shall beg Leave to cite the Authority of
Mr<i>Dryden</i>. <a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>
Neither is it (says he) so trivial an
Undertaking, to make a Tragedy end happily;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
for it is more difficult to save, than it is to kill.
The Dagger, and the Cup of Poison, are always in
Readiness; but to bring the Action to the last
Extremity, and then, by probable Means, to recover
all, will require the Art and Judgment of a
Writer, and cost him many a Pang in the Performance."
As to the Advantage, the Rewards
and Punishments, by this Means, are more equitably
adjusted: Which, indeed, may be tolerably affected
in those Tragedies, which end unfortunately; For
there, the chief Characters, being generally wicked,
meet with that Punishment they deserve, and so
strike a Terror into the Audience, which is accompanied,
likewise, with some Mixture of Pity; for it
is not necessary they should be notoriously wicked,
to merit Punishment. Besides, sometimes they <i>repent</i>
before they go off the Stage; as we have seen in two
or three <i>English</i> Tragedies lately publish'd, which
have met with that Applause they justly deserv'd:
And even the Punishment of Robbers and Assassins,
how justly soever they may deserve it, raises some
Degrees of Compassion in us. I may add, farther,
that in this Kind of Tragedy the <i>Under-characters</i>,
which are innocent and virtuous, may at the Conclusion
be rewarded for those Virtues, whatsoever
Misfortunes they have struggled with before. Upon
the whole, from comparing what has been said, it is
plain, that even in those Tragedies which end unhappily,
there is a <i>Possibility</i> that poetical Justice (as it is
call'd) may be preserv'd: Tho' the other Sort is <i>better</i>
adapted to this Purpose, where the <i>chief Characters</i>
receive their proper Reward, the Virtuous made
happy, and the Wicked miserable.</p>

<p class="indent">Terror is chiefly excited in us by a Representation
of bad Men punish'd with Misfortunes; Pity with a
Mixture of Terror, by a View of good Men under
the same Circumstances; both Passions indifferently,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
by those who are not remarkable either for their Virtues,
or their Vices. I have put the Case of good
Men punish'd with Misfortunes, for it is consistent
with the exactest Justice of the Drama, to make the
most innocent meet the most disastrous Fate; a Sort
of Tragedy the most tragical, of which our own
Stage supplies us with many Instances. This Practice,
I say, must be consistent with poetical Justice,
which is strictly so with the divine. It was, indeed,
less equitable upon the ancient Stage, when the Heathens
knew very little of the Rewards and Punishments
of a future State: But with us <i>Christians</i> the
Case is entirely different.</p>

<p class="indent">But tho' it is no Injustice to represent
good Men labouring under Distress, even at the last; yet the
Wicked should never come off in real Triumph, and
Satisfaction: They should always, at least, be so far
Sufferers, that if Death is not inflicted on them,
nor any other external Punishment; yet they should
feel the Anguish of their own Minds, and not enjoy
any secret Satisfaction in their Vices. On the other
Hand, tho' good Men, to raise our Compassion, are
sometimes put to Death; yet we should, even then,
see them supported by a just Consciousness of their
own Innocence, and the Hopes of a better Life:
For tho' the Things of this World are dispos'd of in
so dark and uncertain a Manner as to make us often
lament the Condition of the best of Men; yet Poets,
like Preachers, should not fail to remind the
Audience, that there certainly will be eternal Punishments
and Rewards hereafter.</p>

<p class="indent space-below">"<i>The best Tragedies</i> (says<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
<i>Vossius</i>) <i>are those where
the Characters are neither perfectly virtuous, nor
extreamly wicked</i>." If this Rule is to be confin'd
to some of the Characters only, it is just; but will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
not hold, if extended to all of them. "For the
Design of Tragedy is to raise Terror and Pity."
No Doubt of it. "But when the Wicked are unfortunate,
we are not much dispos'd either to be
terrify'd, or touch'd with Compassion at it. For
<i>who</i> (as <i>Tully</i> says) <i>is ever mov'd at the Punishment
of a Traitor, or a Parricide</i>? It should rather raise
a Sort of Satisfaction in us, to think that Justice
has overtaken those that have so well deserv'd it?"
But, with Submission to the great Names of <i>Cicero</i>
and <i>Vossius</i>, all good and generous Minds are affected
with <i>Compassion</i> at the Execution of Rebels and Traitors;
and nothing can be more <i>terrible</i> than the Punishment
inflicted upon some of them. "Nor
should they be Characters of unblemish'd Virtue;
for Calamities of a good Man raise a secret
Indignation; and it looks like a Sort of Inhumanity
to suppose that the best of Men may be most
miserable; to which I may add, that such a Representation
may have some Influence in deterring
weak and unthinking Minds from Virtue." There
might be some Reason to believe so, if there was no
other Life but the present; otherwise 'tis a weak
Suspicion. Besides, is there no other Occasion to
introduce good Characters upon the Stage, but to
<i>make them miserable</i>? Has not he himself already<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>
determin'd, that there are some Tragedies which end
unhappily, and others happily? What he has farther
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
advanc'd upon this Subject, is generally right.
"Therefore the <i>properest</i> Characters for the Stage,
are those of a middle Nature, between the two
Extreams of Virtue and Vice; whose Errors, rather
than Crimes, make them unfortunate; as <i>Oedipus</i>
in <i>Sophocles</i>: Or who are reduc'd, by Necessity,
to commit some wicked Action, it being
the last Expedient; as <i>Medea</i> first kills her Brother
<i>Absyrtus</i>, and afterwards her own Children.
Not that these Characters are always requisite; for
<i>Ægisthus</i> and <i>Clytæmnestra</i> are unpardonably
wicked; <i>Electra</i> is good; <i>Orestes</i> rather virtuous,
than not; <i>Agamemnon</i> cannot be said to be bad,
for tho' he sacrifices <i>Iphigenia</i> in <i>Aulis</i>, it is only
in Obedience to the Oracle, and against his own
Inclination. Nor can <i>Hercules</i> be said to appear
in an indifferent Light, but rather in a good one.
Wherefore we are not to conclude that those Tragedies
must be entirely condemn'd, which are not
in all Respects agreeable to <i>Aristotle</i>'s Rules; but
rather, that those are the best, which are conformable
to them." The <i>most tragical</i> (with Submission
to the learned Author) rather than the <i>best</i>, if the
Rules he speaks of are really <i>Aristotle</i>'s. For I am
not satisfied, I confess, that they are his, nor does
<i>Vossius</i> direct us where to find them<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
Otherwise I am entirely of his Opinion in the rest I have quoted
from him; except that I do not perfectly understand
how it is possible for Men to act wickedly, <i>ratione
summa</i><a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>.

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>Twenty-eighth Lecture.</i></b></div>

<p class="indent">We are come now to the Conclusion of the Definition;
in the last Clause of which, expressing the Invention
of Tragedy, after these Words, <i>to raise the
Passions, particularly those of Pity and Terror</i>; we
have the following, and <i>to purge the Mind from them</i>.
It remains, therefore, for us to shew, by what Means
Tragedy <i>purges the Passions</i>, and that by putting them
in Motion, which seems to promise a quite contrary
Effect: And when that is done, just to point out
whence that Pleasure arises, which we receive from
Tragedy; or from what the Causes discoverable in
the inmost Recesses of our Nature, our Minds are
delighted with Sorrow, and feel a pleasing Anguish,
even from Terror and Commiseration. To these
Enquiries, I shall, at present, content myself with a
short Answer, which shall be enlarg'd hereafter, in a
Work that will be publish'd in our own Tongue, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
few Months hence, and which has already had the
Honour of being encourag'd, by the Subscriptions of
several Gentlemen in this Body; to whom I here return
my publick Acknowledgments. The Work I
mean, is an <i>English Translation of Virgil's Æneis</i>:
Where, in some Observations upon the fourth Book,
this nice and difficult Point shall be discuss'd at large.
In the mean Time, the Nature of my present Design
makes it necessary for me just to touch upon it here.</p>

<p class="indent">Are the Passions, then, to be purg'd, even
by their being put in Agitation? Yes; and why not? Bile
and Phlegm, and other Humours in the Human Body,
cannot be carried off, unless they are first fermented,
and put in Motion: Nay, Humours are often expell'd
by Medicines of the same Nature and Temperament;
as Acids by Acids; Bitters by Bitters; and
so of the rest. Some of the Passions, therefore, are
purg'd by themselves, as Terror, and Pity; others,
again, by the Means of these two. Terror and Pity,
as I have said, have this Effect upon themselves;
because such dramatical Representations make us
more accustom'd to miserable and dreadful Objects;
on which Account they become more familiar to us,
and, consequently, affect us with less Misery and Terror.
"By this Means, (says<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
<i>Vossius</i>) Tragedy is said περαινειν την των τοιουτων παθηματων καθαρσιν,
to purge and relieve the Mind from such Perturbations;
just as (to mention one Instance out of
many) the View of those Calamities, which have
formerly been the Lot of great Men, teaches
others to bear their present Afflictions with Patience.
To which Purpose, <i>Athenæus</i> has quoted
some elegant Verses of <i>Timocles</i>, at the Beginning
of his sixth Book." And in another Place, says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
<i>Vossius</i>,<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
The Design of Tragedy is to strike a
Terror in the Audience, ικπληζαι, as <i>Polybius</i>
expresses it in his second Book, where he is discoursing
against <i>Phylarchus</i> of the different Ends
which Historians and Tragic Poets have in
View. The Audience feel this Emotion from a
View of the Calamity before them, and the Anguish
is still heighten'd by the Dignity of the Sufferers.
But the Design of this Emotion is to purge
the Mind from those very Passions. For, as a Veteran
Soldier, or Physician, by being often conversant
with Objects of real Misery, have this Advantage,
that they make no greater Impression upon
them, than they ought; so, in Tragedy, by seeing
the violent Effects of the Passions, the Mind is
taught to restrain them within due Bounds. Hence
it is plain, why <i>Aristotle</i> says, as we observ'd, that
the End of Tragedy is to <i>purge the Passions</i>; in
which he differs entirely from <i>Plato</i>, who look'd
upon Tragedies as the Inflammatories of them,
<i>Aristotle</i> as their proper Correctives."</p>

<p class="indent">To which I may add, that when the Passions
have been long exercis'd with imaginary Distress, their
Strength is so much abated, that they have the less
left to exert upon real Misery. The Observation
which <i>Simo</i> makes in <i>Terence</i> about deceiving <i>Davus</i>
with the Appearance of a Wedding, may be almost
as justly applied to the Excess of Passion (for the Excess
is what we speak of, since the Passions are in themselves good).</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>Habet, ut consumat nunc, cum nihil obsint doli.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Taking the Question, then, in this View,
the Passions may be sometimes purg'd by the Violence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
their own Agitations: As Wind, which is nothing
else but Air in a more rapid Motion, carries off those
noxious Vapours that are mix'd with it, and would
otherwise be the Occasion of Diseases.</p>

<p class="indent">The Passions, therefore, of Terror and Pity,
are purg'd by their own Operations, and the rest by their
Means. For Tragedies not only give us a Representation
of violent and licentious Love, of Anger,
Ambition, Revenge, and the like; but the Audience,
by the Impressions of Terror and Pity, are made to
feel the Effects of them. Yet there seems to be a
Sort of Fallacy in this. Are not some Passions rais'd
to enormous Heights, and a wild Licentiousness,
even by their being represented; especially that of
Love, which seems to be the whole Business of our
modern Tragedies. Have not such Ideas so strongly
impress'd more Influence upon the Imagination, than
the poetical Medicines can carry off, which are not
applied till after the Fit is begun, only by describing
the criminal Excess, or fatal Consequence of these
Passions? As human Nature is but too prone to indulge
the Extravagance of them, may it nor be justly said,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sponte sua properant, labor est inhibere volantes?</i></span>

<span class="i0">The Art must be to moderate their Haste.</span>
<span class="i36"><i>Addison.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>Are they not more inflam'd by the Representation,
than corrected by the Remedy? To these, and all
other Scruples of this Sort, this seems to be the proper
Answer: That these Effects are, or are not to be
expected, just according to the Nature and Manner
of the Performance. As the Case, in Fact, is, an
Audience is more likely to receive ill Impressions,
than Instruction, from modern Tragedies: It is one
Thing to shew the Passions by their <i>Symptoms</i>, (to
use the Language of the Physicians) <i>i.e.</i> by their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
<i>Appearances</i> and <i>Effects</i>; another to represent and
<i>excite</i> them by all the Methods of <i>Insinuation</i> and
<i>Allurement</i>. In this the later Tragedies, especially
those of our own Country, are scandalously faulty:
Not so the ancient, nor the <i>Grecian</i> Writers, who
shame us <i>Christians</i>, by making the Glory of Chastity
their own. But Tragedies that are form'd upon
the Plan of Reason, and of Virtue, please the Mind
without corrupting it: They furnish the Imagination
with agreeable Images, without conveying any
dangerous Poison under the Cover of them; they
unbend the Mind, without debasing it to Softness,
and Effeminacy: They describe and represent the
Passions, as they are seated in all the tumultuous Disorder
in the Soul; but this is so far from exciting us
to the same Extravagance, that it is the sure Way to
deter us from it. There is, I own, something pleasant
in such Descriptions; but the Pleasure rises from
no vicious Source, from no bad Principle; but from
the Imitation, the Elegance, and the Art of the
Poet, which strikes out such lively Images of human
Nature; and, lastly, from the pleasing Anguish which
Terror and Compassion raise within us: Which suggests
to me the other Enquiry, that of accounting
for the secret Causes of this Pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Vossius</i> seems by no Means to give a full Solution
of this Difficulty. "It may be a Question (says he<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>)
how Tragedy can supply us with Delight, which
is the End of all Poetry, since it represents Sorrow
and Distress; and the Misfortunes, especially
those of great Persons, can give no Satisfaction
to a virtuous Mind. In Answer to this Difficulty,
we may observe, that the Pleasure arises not from
the Calamities of others, but from the Art of the
Poet. How much does the Sight of real Dragons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
and Monsters fill us with Terror! but the
Pictures of them give us Pleasure, because we are
entertain'd with the Skill of the Painter. Besides,
it is some Satisfaction, to be acquainted with such
Misfortunes, because they may make us more
cautious and prudent." What <i>Scaliger</i> has said, is
much to the same Purpose. "But here (says he<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>)
it may be objected, that Delight is included in the
very Definition of Poetry: But, in Tragedy, how
can the Anguish of Sorrow, Mourning and Distress,
be entertaining? The Reason is, because Pleasure
does not flow from Joy only, but from acquiring
any Sort of Learning. Now the Spectator
has the Benefit of making such an Acquisition;
thus we behold Pictures with Pleasure,
and are delighted with the most hideous
Forms." But neither of these Answers come up
to the Point: Undoubtedly great Part of the Pleasure
that is given us, arises, as we before observ'd,
from the Skill of the Poet, but from Nature a much
greater, which <i>Vossius</i> and <i>Scaliger</i><a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>
take no Notice of. Indeed, we may learn, and our Prudence may,
and ought to be improv'd by these Representations:
But the Mind, in the Pleasure it receives, has no Regard
to these prudential Considerations. The Pleasure,
therefore, of Pity, seems to arise, first, from
hence, that if Things go well with us, another Man's
Miseries, plac'd in View before us, make us more
sensible of our own Happiness, and teach us to feel
the Value of it: According to <i>Lucretius</i>'s Observation,
so often quoted:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>If we are in Affliction, the Representation of the
like Miseries makes our own more supportable. In
both these Cases, the Pleasure arises from the Comparison,
a Principle to which great Part of the Misery
and Felicity of human Life is owing. It is commonly
said, that <i>no Body is miserable but by Comparison</i>;
and it may be as truly said, that <i>no Body is happy
but by Comparison</i>. But perhaps it may be here observ'd,
that this Solution does not reach the Difficulty:
Pity has no Relation to ourselves, but to others;
I should rather think it has to both: And
how much soever we apply it to others, the Estimate
is made from ourselves. Nor is this alone sufficient
to explain fully the Point in Question: Another
Cause of this Pleasure is, the Operation of the
Mind upon itself, or (what the Schools call) its <i>reflex
Act</i>. It contemplates that generous and humane
Disposition, which inclines it towards others, and is
conscious that this Commiseration does, in some
Measure, arise from it. Perhaps it may be objected,
that these two Principles are not consistent, since the
one is an Evidence of Self-love, the other of a great
and generous Mind: I shall take another Opportunity,
as I have said, of shewing the strict Alliance
there is between these two Principles; and that Self-love,
taken in its full Latitude, ought to be allow'd
as the Source of all our Passions, and the great Principle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
of human Actions<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>.
As to Terror, the Delight it gives us in Tragedy, comes from hence; at
first, (so rapid is the Current of our Ideas) we are affected
with this Appearance of Distress, as if it was
real; and then, by an agreeable Turn of Thought,
we recollect, that this is all imaginary, and that there
is no Danger. There are other Circumstances<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>,
which I shall take no Notice of at present, nor stay
to enlarge upon those Hints I have given, because I shall
examine them more at large in the foremention'd Dissertation.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Æschylus</i>, <i>Sophocles</i>, and <i>Euripides</i>,
the only <i>Greek</i> Tragic Poets that we have now left, are well known.</p>

<p class="indent">If we compare the ancient and modern Writers
of Tragedy, the latter are much superior in forming and
unravelling the Plot. The former have shewn a
good deal of this Contrivance in their Comedies, but
in their Tragedies very little; the Moderns in both.
The chief Design of the ancient Tragic Poets was,
to raise Terror, rather than Pity; of the Moderns,
Compassion rather. The former excel in the Greatness
and Magnificence of their Sentiments; the
latter in the Variety, and passionate Parts of them.
In one you have more Excellencies, in the other
fewer Faults. Among the Moderns, none deserve
any Comparison but the <i>French</i> Writers and
our own: They, indeed, are elegant, ingenious,
exact in observing Rules, and fond of imitating
the Ancients; but want Spirit, Vigour, and poetic Fire:</p>

Kind of Poetry: And no Wonder we should finish
our Dissertations here, where the utmost Bounds
are set to human Compositions. What <i>Scaliger</i> said

<p>For Mr. <i>Rapin</i> has very justly observ'd, An Epic, or
Heroic Poem, properly so call'd, is, undoubtedly,
the greatest Work which the Soul of Man is capable
of performing. We have already observ'd, in our
first Lecture, that all the other Branches of this divine
Art are summ'd up, and included in this one:
And in a Dissertation which I have written in another
Language<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>,
I have attempted to give a short
Account of the Reason of it. What I have now to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
say upon this Subject, which is so much superior to
all others, for the Excellence and Extent of it, is not
so much as the Dignity of it deserves; because I
have already enter'd into many Particulars, which
belong to it, as the Nature of the Subject, I undertook
to discuss, made it necessary; particularly,
when I gave a View of Poetry in general, and the
several particular Branches of it; when I treated of
the <i>Poetic Style, the Beauty of its Thoughts, or the
Elegance and Sublimity of them, of the Drama in general,
and Tragedy</i>, a Species of it. For these Sorts
of Poetry have many Things in common:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">&mdash;&mdash;<i>Alterius sic</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Altera poscit opem res, &amp; conjurat amice.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>And several Things, which have a Relation to this
Subject, I have consider'd more at large elsewhere,
in another<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>Language. What I mean, will, perhaps,
be better understood in the Progress of this Discourse;
for nothing, Gentlemen, can be more disagreeable
to you and me, than a needless Repetition
of the same Things, and saying what has been said a
thousand Times over.</p>

<p class="indent">Mons. <i>Bossu</i>, a <i>French</i> Gentleman,
and an excellent Critic, has given us a Discourse upon Epic Poetry,
in his own Language, which is well known; a Treatise
every Way worthy of the Applause which the
Learned have bestow'd upon it. But it had been no
Derogation to its Merit, if some Parts of it had
been a little more concise: For the Author, how
eminent soever for Penetration of Thought, Soundness
of Judgment, and Variety of Erudition; seems
to pursue his Observations too minutely, and gives
us Distinctions without End. And too many Distinctions
must obscure, rather than explain the Meaning of a Writer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
An Epic, or Heroic Poem, may be thus defin'd:
<i>It is a Poem express'd in Narration, form'd upon a
Story partly real, and partly feign'd; representing, in
a sublime and flowing Style, some glorious and fortunate
Action, that is distinguish'd by a Variety of great
Events; to form the Morals, and inflame the Mind
with the Love of heroic Virtue.</i> This Definition is
more regular in Form, and more comprehensive, as
to the Matter of it, than Mons. <i>Bossu</i>'s: He, following
the Method of his own Definition, divides his
whole Work into six Books; the first treats of the
Nature of an Epic Poem, which includes the Fable;
the second, the Matter, or the Action of the Poem;
the third, the Form, or the Narration; the fourth,
the Moral, or the Characters of the Persons concern'd;
the fifth, the Machinery, or the Appearance
and Influence which the Gods have in it; the sixth,
concludes with the Thoughts, and the Style.</p>

<p class="indent">He pursues each of these Articles at large,
and discusses them with a great deal of Wit, Learning, and
Judgment; but the Method he has chosen, seems not
so proper. The <i>Nature</i> of the Thing defin'd contains
all the Particulars of it, and therefore ought not
to have been a distinct Branch of his Division, which
should (as is usual) have been so form'd, as to
have distinguish'd only three different Parts of the
Definition, namely, the Matter, the Form, and the
End: The <i>Matter</i> includes the Action and the Fable,
under which are rang'd the Incidents, Episodes,
Characters, Morals, and Machinery; the <i>Form</i> comprehends
the Way, or Manner of the Narration,
whether by the Poet himself, or by any of the Persons
introduc'd, whose Discourses are related: To
this Branch, likewise, belongs the moving of the Passions,
the Descriptions, Discourses, Sentiments,
Thoughts, Style, and Versification; and beside these,
the Similes, Tropes, Figures, and, in short, all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
Ornaments and Decorations of the Poem. The
<i>End</i> is to improve our Morals, and increase our Virtue,
which is of itself so plain and obvious, that
there is no Occasion to say much about it.</p>

<p class="indent">I thought it requisite just <i>to mention</i> the
several Parts of Epic Poetry, tho' I do not design to <i>enlarge</i>
upon all of them: Because, in the Course of these
Lectures, I have already touch'd upon several of
them, as they fell in with Arguments of the same
Kind; many of them have been particularly consider'd,
<i>viz.</i> the Action, and the Fable, (for these are almost
the very same, both in Epic and Dramatic Poetry)
the Morals, Characters, the different Kinds of
Narration, the Passions, Descriptions, Sentiments,
the Sublimity of Style and Thought, the Versification,
Comparisons, Tropes, Figures, and all the other
Embellishments of Poetry: What remains,
therefore, is only to offer some scatter'd Observations
upon those Heads, which relate more especially to
Epic Poetry, with such Remarks, as have not yet
been taken Notice of. And, after all, this will look
more like the Gleanings, than the Harvest. When
I have done this, I propose to translate one Chapter
of <i>Bossu</i> where he explains the Nature and Origine
of Epic Poetry. It is a short one, but remarkable
for its Elegance and Perspicuity. And, lastly, I shall
add some Reflections upon the most celebrated Writers
of Epic Poetry, both ancient and modern.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Aristotle</i>, in his Book of Poetry, the
only one that is now left, has allotted only two Chapters for the
Consideration of Epic separately; tho' he often
mentions it, in shewing the Relation it bears to Tragedy:
The Reason of which is very evident, because
most of what he said of the one, might be applied to
the other; and therefore, in those two Chapters, he
has done very little more than adjust the Rules of
the Drama to Epic Poetry, observing, all along, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
Distinction between these two Sons of Poetry,
which the Nature of them required; and interspersing,
now and then, the Praises of <i>Homer</i>. I might
(if you would excuse the Comparison) say the same
Thing of these Dissertations, which is one Reason
why I have not treated this Subject more at large.</p>

<p class="indent">There is the same Difference between the
Fable and the Action, both in Epic and Tragic Poetry,
namely, the Action is an Achievement of some eminent
Person, which produc'd some great and memorable
Event. The Fable is the Complication of all
those Incidents, Episodes, and other Circumstances,
which promote the Action, and carry it to its proper
Period, or else which serve to illustrate, or to embellish
and adorn it. Episodes are either absolutely
necessary, or very requisite: All Episodes are not Incidents<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>,
tho' all Incidents are Episodes; because
some Incidents are not <i>adventitious</i> to the Action,
(which, as the Etymology of the Word implies, is
essential to an Episode) but make up the very Form
and Series of it: Or (to use a more harsh and inelegant
Expression) they are not <i>collateral</i>, but <i>direct</i>
Parts of it; these, and many other Particulars of this
Sort, for the Reason so often mention'd, will not be
enlarg'd upon at present.</p>

<p class="indent">The Action, in Epic Poetry, must, of Necessity, be
<i>one</i>, as well as in Tragedy; tho' it may, and ought to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
be more comprehensive. As to the Place of Action,
there is no confining it to any certain Bounds; Epic
has certainly a much larger Range than Tragedy;
but the more it keeps within Compass, the more perfect
and entire the Action seems to be. <i>Aristotle</i> expressly
says, that as to Time, there is no fixing it to
any determin'd Period. <i>Homer</i>'s <i>Iliad</i> does not contain
above the Space of forty-seven Days<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>;
the <i>Odyssee</i> (as <i>Bossu</i><a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>,
and, after him, <i>Dacier</i>, are of Opinion) takes up eight Years,
and six Months; the <i>Æneid</i> almost seven Years. But, in this Point,
these great Criticks seem not to have made so just a Determination;
for not every Thing that is related by
the Poet, or the Persons he has introduc'd, makes,
strictly speaking, a Part of the Action, but that, only,
which is perform'd by the Hero, and his Associates,
from that Place, where you enter upon the Poem, to
the Conclusion of it. For Instance; the Action of
the <i>Æneid</i>, in a strict and proper Sense, does not begin
at the building of the wooden Horse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;<i>Fracti bello, fatisque repulsi.</i>&emsp;&emsp; Æn. II. 13.</span>
</div></div>

<p>But from the Time that <i>Æneas</i> set Sail from one of
the Ports of <i>Sicily</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Vix è conspectu Siculæ telluris in altum.</i>&emsp;&emsp; I. 38.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">And taking the Question in this View, Mons. <i>Segrais</i>,
in the Preface to his admirable <i>French</i> Translation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
of the <i>Æneid</i>, has demonstrated, that the Action of
that divine Poem falls within the Compass of one Year. And
we may observe almost the same Thing of <i>Homer</i>'s <i>Odyssee</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">I think <i>Dacier</i> has mistaken the Meaning of
<i>Aristotle</i> in another Place, tho' there, also, he follows
<i>Bossu</i>; and that is, with Regard to the Actions or
Adventures of the Persons. Epic (says that Philosopher)
is μιμησιϛ σπουδαιων, which <i>Dacier</i> translates
thus; <i>the Imitation of the Actions of illustrious Persons</i>,
not of illustrious Actions. And perhaps that is
not amiss: But I cannot be of his Opinion, when he
declares, that if the Persons are illustrious, it is of
no great Moment, whether the Actions are so, or
not. He very justly affirms, that the most glorious
Actions of private Men are not a proper Subject for
an Heroic Poem; but then the other Point must be
given against him, that it is necessary, that <i>not the
Person only, but the Action, should be illustrious</i>. All
the Actions, even of <i>Alexander</i> or <i>Cæsar</i>, <i>Achilles</i>
or <i>Æneas</i>, are surely not proper for Epic. I agree,
therefore, that <i>Aristotle</i> must be understood to mean
the Actions of Heroes; but then he would also imply,
the Actions of Heroes, as Heroes. And, no
doubt, <i>Horace</i> was of the same Opinion, (tho' <i>Dacier</i>
brings him in as an Evidence on his Side) when he says,</p>

<p>What <i>Bossu</i> further advances<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> in Support of his Opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
is of no great Moment, <i>viz.</i> that the little
Enmities in the <i>Iliad</i>, and in the <i>Odyssey</i> the Return
of an Exile into his Country, are Actions equally
suitable to private Men and Heroes. I confess,
(and so does he) that <i>Æneas</i>'s restoring his Country,
as it were, and laying the Foundation of a new
Kingdom; are much more heroical: But even those
above-mention'd, as they are set off by <i>Homer</i>, with
their heroical Circumstances, could not but have
been great, tho' they had been done by private Men.
In the <i>Iliad</i>, indeed, and more especially in the <i>Odyssey</i>,
some Things are related below the Majesty of
Epic; as for Instance, what the Poet tells us of <i>Ulysses</i>'s
Herdsman and Swineherd; which <i>Ovid</i> has
thought fit to copy in <i>Penelope</i>'s Epistle to that Chief:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>These, I own, are not represented as the Actions of
the Hero himself; but still are unworthy to be mention'd
in an Heroic Poem. The Simplicity of ancient
Times is alledg'd, in Excuse for Things of this
Nature; and, for my Part, I am willing to admit it:
But, certainly, let the Men live in what Age you
please, they stood in Need of some Excuse. <i>Virgil</i>
has nothing of this Kind; who has a much better
Right than <i>Homer</i> to that Encomium of <i>Horace</i><a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>,

<p>Throughout the <i>Æneid</i> there is nothing mean, nothing
dishonourable, nothing that is not truly heroic.
As to the forming of a Hero, he is not to be represented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
adorn'd with every Virtue, as a Character entirely
perfect, because there is no such Thing in Nature;
but he may advance as near as possible to that
Perfection. <i>Ulysses</i> and <i>Æneas</i>, indeed, are at no
great Distance from it; but what Sort of a Hero is <i>Achilles</i>!</p>

<p>These are heroical Virtues, no doubt! an admirable
Image of a Demi-god! But more of this in another
Place.</p>

<p class="indent">There are two Things which chiefly distinguish
Epic from Tragedy, the <i>Manner of the Representation</i>,
and the <i>Event</i>, or <i>Catastrophe</i>. As to the former,
it is certain, that Tragedy is form'd upon Action,
and Epic upon Narration. For what <i>Aristotle</i> says of
Epic,<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>
ὁτι δει τουϛ μυθουϛ καθαπερ ἑν ταιϛ τραγωδιαιϛ συνισταναι δραματικουϛ,
<i>that the Fable, as in Tragedy, ought to be dramatical</i>, it is plain,
from the very Words, must be understood of the <i>Fable</i>, which
ought to be active, <i>i.e.</i> lively, full of Motion, and
growing warmer, as it comes nearer the Conclusion;
and has no Relation to the <i>Form</i>, or <i>Manner
of representing</i>, or <i>imitating</i>, which, as every Body
knows, in Heroic Poetry is, and always was, narrative,
and not dramatic.</p>

<p class="indent space-below">They differ, also, in the Event, or Conclusion.
In Tragedy, the Conclusion is <i>generally</i> unfortunate,
but <i>never</i> so in Epic; the Reasons of which
Rule are, <i>First</i>, The Examples of <i>Homer</i>, and <i>Virgil</i>,
who are, and ought te be our Guides, and Masters;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
even <i>Achilles</i>, the Hero of the Poem as he is,
tho' very undeservedly, comes off with Success;
and much more should <i>Ulysses</i> and <i>Æneas</i>. In this
Particular these Writers have been universally follow'd
by all, who wou'd be thought Epic Writers;
for which Reason, <i>Statius</i> (as <i>Bossu</i> has observ'd) rather
chose to break the Unity of the Action, than
make his <i>Thebais</i> end unfortunately, after the miserable
Fratricide of <i>Eteocles</i> and <i>Polynices</i>. And not
only the Authority of these Poets, but the very
Reason of the Thing, supplies us with Arguments for
this Rule. <i>First</i>, Altho' in Tragedy (where the Action
is much shorter, more simple, and finish'd, as
it were, at a Heat) an unfortunate Conclusion may
be so far from displeasing, that it may be agreeable
to the Audience; yet in Epic, after such a Series
and Variety of Adventures, after sustaining so many,
and so great Difficulties, the Reader must be out of
Humour with the Poet, unless the whole should
conclude happily at last. <i>2dly</i>, The chief End of
Tragedy is, to purge the Passions, especially those of
Terror and Pity, by a short and brisk Emotion; but
the Design of Epic Poetry is, by more slow and leisurely
Operations, to remove bad Habits, and restore
good ones; to subdue Vice, and recommend Virtue;
which would be done with a very ill Grace, if the
Hero of the Poem, or the Prince endu'd with heroic
Virtue, (for such he either is, or ought to be) should
come to a deplorable End. <i>3dly</i>, An Epic Poem,
properly so call'd, is, and always must be written in
Honour of the Country, or the Religion of the Author;
between which, and the Hero, there is a near
Relation; and therefore he ought to come off in
Triumph at last. <i>Bossu</i> inclines to this Opinion, nay,
<i>expressly</i> determines, that this is the <i>truer</i> Conduct.
I have ventur'd to advance a Step further, being of
Opinion, for the Reasons now alledg'd, it is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
only proper, but essential to Heroic Poetry; and, in
Consequence of that Opinion, have made a happy
Conclusion Part of the Definition. The two Differences,
therefore, that we spoke of, between Tragedy
and Epic, are (as the Schools term it) <i>specific</i>
Differences, the others are only <i>accidental</i>; those are
Differences in <i>Nature</i>, these only in <i>Degree</i>,
<i>Extent</i>, or <i>Greatness</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>Thirtieth Lecture.</i></b></div>

<p class="indent">The Moderns seem to mistake that
Part of Epic and Tragedy which contains
the το θαυμασον, or the <i>wonderful</i>, confounding
the <i>wonderful</i> with the <i>improbable</i>, and using
those two Words promiscuously. If it was really so,
the το θαυμασον would always be faulty; for that is
always faulty, which is improbable. These poetical
Prodigies would be improbable, if they were represented
to be perform'd by any human Power: But
the Case is quite different. The Divine Power, and
the Agency of the Gods, make all this agreeable to
Reason. Thus, in <i>Homer</i>, that the Horses should
speak; and, in <i>Virgil</i>, that the Myrtle Roots should
drop Blood, is wonderful, but not improbable: For
our most ingenious Translator of <i>Homer</i> seems to be
mistaken, when he asserts, that these were perform'd
without the Interposal of the Gods. As to the latter,
<i>Virgil</i><a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>
expresly declares it to be a Prodigy:</p>

<p>But plainer still, in what follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>
<i>Monstra deum refero.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>As to <i>Homer</i>, he, in express Terms, asserts, that
<i>Juno</i> made the Horse speak<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>:

</div></div>

<p>In such Cases as these, whatsoever is possible, is probable:
If you determine otherwise, Poetry is depriv'd
of one of its best Ornaments, its greatest Fund
of Surprize. And the same Observation extends to
some Parts of the wonderful, which are not accounted
for by a divine Power: As in the Instance of <i>Polyphemus</i>,
and the other <i>Cyclops</i>, in <i>Homer</i> and <i>Virgil</i>.
That there were really Giants, is an Opinion, which not
only the Ancients believ'd, but the Scriptures have
confirm'd: But whether <i>such</i> Giants were ever in Being,
as are there describ'd, is a Point of no Moment.
Therefore <i>Virgil</i>'s Description of <i>Polyphemus</i> is very
injudiciously censur'd by some Criticks:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>This is so far from being improbable, or carrying the
Hyperbole too far, that nothing can be more elegant
and sublime; especially if we consider the Nature of
Fear, which always enlarges what is great, and raises
a Train of Horrors upon one another. It is, indeed,
very hyperbolical; but the Nature of the Thing describ'd,
not only excuses, but demands that Boldness.
I own <i>Homer</i> has a few Examples of the improbable;
and there is one Instance of this Kind in <i>Virgil</i>;
I mean where <i>Camilla</i> is describ'd in those most
elegant Verses,</p>

<p class="indent">In my Definition of Epic Poetry, I inserted
this Clause, <i>that it must be form'd upon a Story partly
real, and partly fictitious</i>: For both these are equally
necessary. In Tragedy, which is so much shorter,
the Performance may not only be excusable, but
commendable, tho' the whole Fable should be fictitious:
But in a long Work, such as an Heroic Poem
is, the Reader will be tir'd, unless he has the Pleasure
of finding some Truth interwoven with the Fable.
Besides, an Heroic Poet writes, or ought to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
write after the Examples of <i>Homer</i> and <i>Virgil</i>,
in Honour of the Country he belongs to, or the Religion
he professes; and then it must be necessary that he
should have some Regard to popular Opinions, or
true History. This is requisite, at least to the well-being,
if not the very being of an Heroic Poem.</p>

<p class="indent">Little need be said about the Machinery,
which, among the ancient Heathens, was the Agency of
their false Gods, and of Angels and Demons among
us <i>Christians</i>; its Beauty and Magnificence being well
known. The Dignity of an Heroic Poem would
scarce be kept up without it, especially since the
το θαυμαστον or the Marvellous, depends upon it. I
shall say no more, but refer the Reader to the fifth
Chapter of <i>Bossu</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The Versification of Heroic Poetry is what
no Body is a Stranger to, which, among the <i>Greeks</i> and
<i>Romans</i> consisted of Hexameters. This Kind of
Verse is so peculiar to Epic, that when it is us'd upon
other Occasions, it is commonly call'd Heroic Verse.
It is needless to observe how numerous, and sublime,
and beautiful, in all Respects, it is, and how much it
has tended to ennoble those Languages: Our <i>English</i>
Verse comes nearest to it, both in Gravity and Majesty,
but at how great Distance? which yet, is, at
least, both in Strength and Energy, far superior to
the <i>French</i> and <i>Italian</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">I have made these few scatter'd Reflections
upon Heroic Poetry, and propose to add no more, at present,
for a Reason I have hinted before. As to the
Nature and Origin of it, I shall only offer the following
clear and succinct Account from the
second Chapter of the first Book of the learned <i>Bossu</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">"The most considerable Difference my
Subject presents me with, between the Style of the
Ancients and Moderns, is, that our Way of Speaking
is plain, proper, and without Circumlocution;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
whereas theirs was full of Mysteries and Allegories:
The Truth was generally conceal'd under
those ingenious Inventions, which, for their Excellence,
are call'd <i>Fables</i>, or <i>Sayings</i>; as if there
was as much Difference between those fabulous
Discourses of the Wife, and the ordinary Language
of the Vulgar, as there is between the Language
proper to Men, and the Sounds which
Beasts use, to express their Passions and Sensations.</p>

<p class="indent">"The first Use of Fables was to speak
of the divine Nature, according to the Notions they had
of it. This sublime Subject caused the first Poets
to be styl'd <i>Divines</i>, and Poetry <i>the Language of the
the Gods</i>. They divided the divine Attributes, as it
were, into so many Persons, because the Weakness
of the Human Mind could not well conceive
or explain so much Power and Action in a Simplicity
so great and indivisible, as that of God is.
And perhaps they were jealous of the Advantages
they receiv'd from such excellent and refin'd
Learning, which they thought the vulgar Part of
Mankind were not worthy of.</p>

<p class="indent">"They could not tell us of the Operations
of this Almighty Cause, without speaking, at the same
Time, of its Effects: So to <i>Divinity</i> they added
<i>Physiology</i>, and treated of it in the same Manner,
without quitting the Umbrages of their allegorical Expressions.</p>

<p class="indent">"But <i>Man</i> being the chief, and most
noble of all the Effects which God produc'd, and nothing being
so proper, or so useful to <i>Poets</i>, as this Subject,
they added it to the former, and treated of
<i>Morality</i> in the same Way that they did of <i>Divinity</i>
and <i>Physicks</i>. And from Morality thus discours'd
of, Art has form'd that Kind of <i>Poem</i>
and Fable which we call <i>Epic</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Poets did the same Thing in <i>Morality</i>,
which the Divines did in <i>Theology</i>. That infinite
Variety in the divine Actions and Operations, so
much above our Understanding, forc'd them, as
it were, upon dividing the single Idea of the one,
and uncompounded divine Essence, into several
Persons, under the Names of <i>Jupiter</i>, <i>Juno</i>,
<i>Neptune</i>, and the rest: On the contrary, the Nature
of <i>Moral Philosophy</i> being such as never lays down
Rules for any particular Thing, has oblig'd the
<i>Epic Poets</i> to unite in one single idea, in one and
the same Person, and into one Action, which appear'd
extraordinary, all that look'd like it in different
Persons, and in different Actions, which
might be thus contain'd as so many <i>Species</i> under
their <i>Genus</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">"Therefore, when <i>Aristotle</i>
says<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>,
φιλοσφωτερον, και σπουδαιοτερον ποιησιϛ ιστοριαϛ ισιν,
<i>That Poetry is more philosophical, and more serious, than History</i>,
he says this, not so much to magnify the Excellence
of this Art, as to explain the Nature of it.
<i>Poetry</i>, says he, <i>teaches Morality, not by a bare
Recital, as an Historian, who tells us what</i> Alcibiades
<i>did, or suffer'd</i>, (which is <i>Aristotle</i>'s own Instance;)
<i>but by proposing all that a Person, let the Poet call
him by what Name he pleases, ought either necessarily,
or most probably to have said, or done, upon
such an Occasion</i>. It is in this Manner, that it lays
down either the unhappy Consequences of ill-judg'd
Designs, and wicked Actions; or else the
Rewards of good Actions, and the Satisfaction
one receives from a Design form'd by Virtue, and
conducted by Prudence. Thus in <i>Epic</i>, according
to <i>Aristotle</i>, let the Names be what they will, yet the
<i>Persons</i> and the <i>Actions</i> are feign'd, <i>allegorical</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
and <i>universal</i>, not <i>historical</i> and
<i>particular</i>.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
Ἡ μεν Ποιησιϛ μαλλον τακαθολου ἡ δ' ιστορια τα καου ἑκαστον; λεγει,
i.e. <i>Poetry represents Things rather in general, but History in particular.
Horace</i> is likewise of the same Mind, who is not satisfy'd with
saying, that Poets teach <i>Morality</i> full as well as
<i>Philosophers</i>; but prefers <i>Homer</i> to all of them:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i36"><i>Creech.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">"The Reason why <i>Poets</i> excel <i>Philosophers</i>
in this Respect is, that every Sort of <i>Poem</i> is an <i>Imitation</i>.
Now Imitation is extremely natural, and
pleases every Body; and therefore nothing is more
likely to engage the Passions, and the Attention, of
an Audience. Besides, Imitation is Instruction by
Examples, and Examples are the most proper Methods
of Persuasion; because they prove that such
or such a Thing is feasible. In short, Imitation is
so much the Essence of Poetry, that the Art it
self, as <i>Aristotle</i> informs us, owes its very Original
to it. And <i>Horace</i> recommends it very particularly
to the Poet, which he is forming:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">By th' Original of Human Life.</span>
<span class="i30"><i>Roscommon.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">"But tho' the <i>Poets</i> become <i>moral Philosophers</i>,
they do not cease to be <i>Divines</i>; on the contrary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
the <i>Morality</i> they treat of, does indispensably oblige
them to have a Vein of Theology run thro'
all their Works: Because the Knowledge, the Fear,
and the Love of God, in a Word, Piety and Religion
are the chief, and most solid Foundations
or the other Virtues, and of all <i>Morality</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Presence of the Deity</i>, and the
Superintendence which so august a Cause has over the Action,
obliges the <i>Poet</i> to represent this <i>Action</i> as great,
important, and manag'd by <i>Kings</i> and <i>Princes</i>.
Hence <i>Horace</i>:</p>

<p>Upon the same Account he is oblig'd to think
and speak in an elevated Way, above the Vulgar,
and in a Style that may, in some Measure, keep up
the Character of the divine Persons he introduces.
To this End serves the poetical and figurative Expression,
and the Majesty of <i>Heroic Verse</i>. As <i>Horace</i> again:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">With Fancy high, and bold and daring Flights.</span>
<span class="i34"><i>Creech.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">"But all this being divine and marvellous, may
quite ruin all <i>Probability</i>, without which an Action
is not likely to persuade. Therefore the Poet
should take special Care, as to this Point, since his
chief Business is to instruct Men, and <i>form them to Virtue</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"To all this the <i>Poets</i> are oblig'd,
by the very Nature of these Things, which they propose for
the Subjects of their Poems and Instructions.
The Manner of teaching them usefully and methodically,
has likewise oblig'd them to add several other Rules.</p>

<p class="indent">"Epic Poetry is directed to the <i>Morals</i> and
the <i>Habits</i>, rather than the <i>Passions</i>. These rise on a
sudden, and their Heat is soon over; but the <i>Habits</i>
are more calm, and come on, and go off
more leisurely: Therefore the <i>Epic Action</i> cannot
be contain'd in one single Day, as the <i>Dramatic</i>.
It must have a longer, and more just Space allow'd
it, than the Action of <i>Tragedy</i>, which is
directed to the <i>Passions</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">"This Distinction makes <i>Tragedy</i> and
<i>Epic</i> differ very much: The Violence of <i>Tragedy</i>
requires a great deal more lively and brisk Representation
than a bare <i>Recital</i>. It is all Action, the Poet never
speaks, as he does in <i>Epic</i>, where there are no Actors.</p>

<p class="indent">"But if, in this Respect, <i>Epic</i> is inferior to
<i>Tragedy</i>, yet it is superior both to <i>Philosophy</i> and
<i>History</i>; because it is a great deal more active than
bare <i>Philosophy</i>, and the Recitals of <i>History</i>: And
tho' it does not, like <i>Tragedy</i>, represent the Action
to the Eyes of the Spectators, yet it ought, more
frequently than <i>History</i>, to break off the Narration,
by intermixing the Speeches of the Persons
represented. This <i>Aristotle</i> directs, when he says,
that <i>the Narration of Epic ought to be dramatic</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> active." [I differ from the learned Author
in the Meaning of this Passage, and agree with
<i>Dacier</i>, as I said before: But it is a Matter of no
great Moment. The Speeches of the Persons may
be <i>included</i> in this Rule of <i>Aristotle</i>'s; but it seems
more applicable to the <i>Fable</i>, which is the <i>Matter</i> of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
the Poem, than to the <i>Form</i>, which is the Way of
representing it. But <i>Bossu</i> adds,]</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Epic</i> has, likewise, its <i>Passions</i>, which
give it no small Advantage over <i>Philosophy</i> and <i>History</i>; but
in this it is still inferior to <i>Tragedy</i>: For tho' it
has a Mixture of all the <i>Passions</i>, yet <i>Joy</i> and
<i>Admiration</i> are the most essential to it. These,
indeed, contribute most towards the making us
wise Men: <i>Admiration</i> and <i>Curiosity</i> are the Cause
of <i>Sciences</i>; and nothing engages the Mind so forcibly
as <i>Pleasure</i>; so that these two Passions must
never be wanting in a Work invented with a View
to teach us what we are indispensably oblig'd to know.</p>

<p class="indent">"To conclude: Because Precepts ought
to be concise, that they may be more easily understood,
and more strongly retain'd in the Memory; and
because nothing can be more effectual to this Purpose
than the proposing one single Idea, and collecting
all Things so well together, that they may
be present to the Mind at once; the <i>Poets</i> have
reduc'd all to one single Action, under one and
the same Design, and in a Body whose Members
and Parts should be homogeneous. Hence arise
two of <i>Horace</i>'s Rules: The one,</p>

<p class="space-below">This is <i>Bossu</i>'s Account of the Origin
and Nature of Epic Poetry.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>Thirty-first Lecture.</i></b></div>

<p class="indent">Under this Head there is very
little Room to make any Comparison between the Ancients
and the Moderns; for these latter Ages have scarce produc'd
any Thing that deserves the Name of an Epic Poem. We
know our Countryman, Mr. <i>Dryden</i>'s Judgment,
about a Poem of <i>Chaucer</i>'s, truly beautiful, indeed,
and worthy of Praise; namely, that it was not only
equal, but even superior to the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Æneid</i>:
But we know, likewise, that his Opinion was not always
the most accurate, nor form'd upon the severest
Rules of Criticism. What was in Hand, was generally
most in Esteem; if it was uppermost in his
Thoughts, it was so in his Judgment too. I am sure,
the Opinion is too monstrous to deserve a serious
Refutation. But even among the Ancients themselves,
if you except <i>Homer</i> and <i>Virgil</i>, you will
scarce find one that is truly an Epic Poet. The heroic
Laurels are due to them only; nor has the
World produc'd <i>two more such Heroes</i>, no, nor one.
How far a Comparison is to be made between this
immortal Pair, and what, in my Opinion, is to be
determin'd, <i>with Regard to their different Merits</i>, I
have declar'd at large in another Place<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>,
and given some Reasons for my Sentiments; namely, that <i>Virgil</i>
is much indebted to <i>Homer</i>; but that <i>Homer</i>'s
Works are inferior to <i>Virgil</i>'s.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The Poems of <i>Lucan</i> and <i>Silius Italicus</i>,
are rather historical, than heroic; their Actions are <i>real</i>,
not <i>fictitious</i>; <i>particular</i>, not <i>universal</i>:
But partake, in some Measure, of the Nature of Epic; as
they are Poems of a considerable Length, express'd
in Narration, and written in Heroic Verse; each of
them have their Heroes; the Thoughts and Language
are sublime, or they would have us think so,
and there are some Degrees of Fiction interwoven
with Truth. They are reducible, therefore, to this
Class, and their Authors have a Right to be mention'd
in it. <i>Lucan</i>, however liable to Censure in
some Things, is, upon the whole, far from being a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
mean Writer, and deserves a very considerable Character.
He is sometimes harsh, and over-stoical;
sometimes cold, and too nearly allied to Prose; and,
again, on the other Hand, he is swelling, bombast,
and affects a Way of Expression ridiculously lofty;
and yet, in many Things, very elegant and sublime,
and full of an heroic Spirit. As to <i>Silius Italicus</i>,
<i>Pliny</i>, in one of his Epistles<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>,
has given the following Character: <i>Scribebat carmina majore cura,
quam ingenio. Virgilii natalem, religiosius quam suum, celebrabat;
Neapoli maxime, ubi monumentum ejus adire,
ut templum, solebat</i> "He wrote Verses with
more Pains, than Genius; he observ'd <i>Virgil</i>'s
Birth-Day more religiously than his own, especially
at <i>Naples</i>, where he us'd to frequent his
Monument as if it had been a Temple." And
since he lov'd <i>Virgil</i> so passionately, that he almost
ador'd him, it is strange he should not have come
nearer to his Style. The same may be said of <i>Lucan</i>.
How much unlike to <i>Virgil</i>'s! It is, also, as
evident, that <i>Statius</i> rather admir'd <i>Virgil</i> than
imitated him. He therefore says very justly,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>
&mdash;<i>Nec tu divinam Æneida tenta.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>But what follows is not so well:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sed longe sequere, &amp; vestigia semper adora.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>For this, with an Appearance of Modesty, insinuates,
that he follow'd <i>Virgil</i>: But at how great a Distance!
with what unequal Steps! How unlike is his Way of
Writing, and Thinking! But even <i>Statius</i> is not
without his Beauties, tho' his Poem is not properly
Epic; for the Heroes of his <i>Thebais</i> are too much
upon a Level, no one is superior to the rest; and,
besides, there are two Actions, one unfortunate; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
the other happy. <i>Tasso</i> is, indeed, truly heroic, and
has justly attain'd no small Esteem. But, to pass by
other Particulars, he is too full of Magic, Enchantments,
Machinery, and aerial Personages. Of the
same Fault our Countryman <i>Spencer</i> is still more
remarkably guilty, who treads almost perpetually upon
enchanted Ground, and the greatest Part of whose
Characters are Fairies, Ghosts, Magicians and Giants.
He is all over Allegory, pursues not one Action
but several, and such as have so little Relation to
each other, that it is difficult to see any Connection.
But, in other Respects, this most ingenious Writer
was born a Poet, if any one ever was. If we consider
his Versification, and especially his Copiousness
of Invention, he is justly celebrated, among the Poets
of the first Class.</p>

<p class="indent">If <i>Milton</i> did not write an Heroic Poem,
properly so call'd, yet he certainly wrote an excellent
one, such as deserves, or rather is above all Commendation.
He is no slavish Imitator of <i>Homer</i> and
<i>Virgil</i>, he opens a Way entirely new, and entirely his
own: In Fruitfulness of Invention, Sublimity of
Genius, in the Weight and Lustre of his Thoughts
and Words, and, lastly, in the Perfection of his Judgment,
he is, perhaps, equal to either of them, tho'
he wrote in a Language much inferior to both
theirs, especially <i>Homer</i>'s; and is particularly much
less correct than <i>Virgil</i>. Let other Moderns imitate
<i>Milton</i>, by imitating <i>Homer</i> and <i>Virgil</i> less:
Let them improve and form themselves, as much as possible,
by their Genius, their Judgment, and their
Way of Writing and Thinking: To do this, is to
imitate; but to transcribe their Poems, or, at least,
a great Part of them, into their own, is not Copying, but Stealing.

<p>Nor think it essential to an Heroic Poem, to describe
the Anger of some great General, the Return
of a King into his own Country, a Colony transplanted
from one Region to another, the Description
of <i>Æolia</i>, and the Winds, the solemn Celebration
of Funeral Games, a Descent into Hell, or
a Hero furnish'd with celestial Armour: But rather
avoid these, and many other Subjects, which are
treated of by <i>Homer</i> and <i>Virgil</i>; and for that very
Reason, because they are so. Whoever attempts an
Heroic Poem, must form a new Plan, and guard
against the Stroke of <i>Horace</i>'s Satire:</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>
<hr class="r65" />

<p class="indent space-below">I have now gone through the
several Particulars I propos'd to treat of in the Course of
these Lectures: What I have too lightly touch'd
upon, or entirely omitted, I leave to my Successors
to discuss more fully, who will supply my Defects,
and correct my Errors. Nothing now remains, but
to return to you, Gentlemen, my heartiest Thanks,
and to testify my sincerest Wishes for your Prosperity.
I should quit this Office with more Regret,
did I not consider, that, at any Time, to have receiv'd
Marks of your Favour, will for ever remain
to me those of Honour. Nothing is in my Power
to return for them, but my most ardent Prayers for
the Welfare of this University, that as it daily receives
fresh Ornaments in Buildings, so it may make
new Acquisitions (if there is Room for any) in
Learning and Virtue, and in its Reputation for both;
and that you may be as secure from the Attempts,
as you are above the Reproaches of your Enemies.
And, surely, unless we are much deceiv'd in our
Hopes, and our Wishes biass us with too fond Credulity,
we may esteem as fresh Omens of our
Happiness, those numerous Towers that rise sacred
to the Muses, even in the most difficult Times; insomuch,
that if we retire from the University but a
few Months, we are almost Strangers to it upon our
Return, and verify the old Saying, tho' from a very
different Reason, <i>Oxonium quærimus in Oxonio</i>, we
seek for <i>Oxford</i> within her own Walls. It is amazing,
then, that Men, who boast of the greatest
Zeal for their Country, should hate and despise that
which is the distinguishing Ornament of it. It
would be blind Partiality in us, if, in other Respects,
we pretended to excel the whole Earth. Brave, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
we are, yet so are the <i>French</i>, so the <i>Germans</i>. Are
we powerful by Sea, and rich in Commerce? the
<i>Dutch</i> are also: And it would be the Height of
Arrogance, to claim to ourselves the Laurels, in
Point of Learning and Ingenuity. But that the <i>English</i>
Universities are not to be parallel'd, is the Confession
and Admiration of all the World: Even one
of them, the less of the Two, I need not say equals,
but exceeds all Foreign Ones together. This Glory
is our peculiar Property, which yet some endeavour
to extinguish, who would be thought strenuous Defenders
of their Country. If you ask me the Reason
for it, I know of none but what the old Saying in
<i>Terence</i> supplies me with, <i>Mala mens, malus animus</i>,
Bad Principles produce bad Designs. To such I wish
true Repentance. As to myself, Words are too
weak to express the Sentiments of my Heart for that
Candour and Affection with which you have honour'd
me with your Attendance, have pardon'd my
Mistakes, and accepted my weak Endeavours. May
the <i>Oxford</i> Muses flourish, for ever flourish, more
and more; and may you, the Encouragers and Promoters
of them, go on to promote them, and, by
your Increase in Poetry, and all other Arts and Sciences,
in Virtue and Learning, afford to Poets perpetual Subjects of Praise.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Page 15. <i>l.</i> 3.</b> <i>Vossius</i>'s Definition
is short as it makes the Essence of Poetry consist solely in Imitation.
<i>Add this Note</i>, The Author of <i>Observations on Poetry
occasioned by the late Poem on Leonidas</i>, <b>p. 71.</b> finds the
same Fault with <i>Aristotle</i>; who "by this, says he,
excludes all descriptive Poetry; and accordingly he
(<i>Aristotle</i>) directs the epic poet to introduce his characters,
and write in dialogue, as much as possible, for
this reason, that when the poet speaks himself, he is
not an imitator. <i>Plato</i> has more justly distinguish'd,
that some kinds of Poetry consist wholly in imitation,
as tragedy and comedy; some in narration only, where
the poet speaks in his own person, as odes; whereas
some, as the epic, contain a mixture of both." For
my Part, I cannot think it any great Violence put
upon Words to allow that <i>Description</i> or <i>Narration</i> is
<i>Imitation</i>. It is certain <i>Aristotle</i> uses the Word
<i>Imitation</i> in this Sense, <b>c. 3.</b>
&ensp;και ναρ ιν τοιϛ αυ τοιϛ και αιτα μιμε αθ αι ισιν, οτι μεν απαγρελλο, η ἑτιρον τε γιγιομενσιϛ,
<i>A Poet may imitate the same Things either by Narration, or by
assuming the Character of some other Person</i>: And <b>c. 22,
23</b>. he distinguishes περι τηϛ οιτε ορθτειν μιμησιωϛ, and περι τηϛ δραγεαστικηϛ,
between <i>Dramatic Imitation</i>, and
<i>Narrative</i>: and <b>c. 2. &amp; 4</b>. he mentions the <i>Dithyrambics</i>
and <i>Nomi</i>, Hymns in Honour of <i>Bacchus</i> and <i>Apollo</i>, and
other Odes, as Instances of Poetic Imitation. Now, I
need not observe, that if in these Hymns and Odes,
Actions, as <i>Dacier</i> contends, were <i>imitated</i> by Description
or Narration, other Things may likewise. Nay
Plato himself has omitted <i>descriptive</i> Poetry, as well as
<i>Aristotle</i> if it is not included under <i>narrative</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">But still, if it is, the ingenious Author will not allow
it to be <i>Imitation</i>, upon the Authority of <i>Plato</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
Now as to <i>Plato</i>, <i>Dan. Heinsius</i> long since observed,
that tho', with Dr. <i>Pemberton</i>, he sometimes speaks of
<i>Imitation</i> as a <i>Species</i> of Poetry, yet at other times he
agrees with <i>Aristotle</i>, in making it the <i>Genus</i>. In short,
these two Philosophers are agreed, that All Poetry is Imitation;
but Dramatic Imitation, or that which is supported
by Dialogue, is more peculiarly so.</p>

<p class="indent">Next let us see if Dr. <i>Pemberton</i>'s own
Account of Poetry will not lead us to think <i>Description</i> to be
<i>Imitation</i>. He observes, <b>p. 75</b>. <i>That it is the peculiar Office
of the Poet</i>, in Opposition to the Prose-writer, <i>to exhibit
continually sensible</i> <span class="smcap">Images</span> <i>of things</i>. Now
<i>Images</i> are surely <i>Likenesses</i> or <i>Imitations</i>;
and whether these are the genuine Images of the Poet's Subject, or
adventitious ones fetch'd in to illustrate it, still 'tis all Imagery:
<i>Imitation</i> is his distinguishing Character. Again, <b>p. 98</b>.
he observes, <i>The language of comedy receives its poetic Air
not by departing from the ordinary forms of speech, but by
keeping more close to them</i>. So that where we almost lose
Sight of Poetry, the Traces of it are preserved by Imitation.
Upon the whole 1. we see <i>Plato</i> and <i>Aristotle</i> use
Imitation in a larger Sense than Dr. <i>Pemberton</i> was aware
of; and 2. the Doctor naturally falls into the Sentiments
of both, while he opposes one of them.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Vossius</i>, it seems, and <i>Dacier</i> go farther,
and suppose that <i>Aristotle</i> makes <i>Poetry consist in the Imitation of</i>
<span class="smcap">Actions</span> <i>only</i>. But the Words, <b>c. 2.</b>
as Dr. <i>Trapp</i> observes, very well bear another Sense,
ιπειδη μιμενται ον μιμουμενοι πορθονταϛ, &amp;c. <i>Since Imitators</i>, or
Poets <i>imitate Actions</i>, i.e. as well as other things; or possibly thus,
joining ποθιτδοιδαϛ to μιμουμενοι, <i>since those that imitate Actions are
Imitators,&mdash;such Actions</i>, he goes on, <i>must be either good or bad</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">As to <i>Dacier</i>, I cannot well make him consistent with
himself: <i>Aristotle</i>, says he, <b>c. 2. rem. 1</b>. <i>lays it down as
an undoubted Principle, that</i> <span class="smcap">All</span> <i>those that imitate,
imitate Actions; and indeed it is so, for there is nothing else
but Actions which can be imitated</i>. And yet upon <i>Aristotle</i>'s
saying that Music is Imitation, he observes, that
<i>whatever employs means to shew and represent</i> <span class="smcap">any Subject</span>
<i>as naturally as may be, whether it</i> <span class="smcap">Does Really Exist</span>
<i>or no, is called Imitation</i>.
Does he by <i>Actions</i> above mean <i>Effects</i>?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
<i>Aristotle</i>, it must be own'd, instances in Actions as the
Objects of Poetic Imitation, being to treat of Epic and
Dramatic Poetry particularly. But he ascribes the Rise of
Poetry in general to the Desire of Imitation, and the Pleasure
we take in comparing the Likeness of Copies with their
Originals. And this Faculty surely is exercised not only
in viewing the Description of a Man, but of a Mountain;
not only in representing the Conflicts of Passion, but</p>

But in the latter, <i>Bossu</i> reduces the <i>Odyssey</i> to fifty
eight Days; and the <i>Æneis</i> either to a Year and somewhat
more, or else to a single Campaign, beginning
where Dr. <i>Trapp</i> does. See <i>Bossu</i> Book II. ch. xviii.
and Book III. c. xii.</p>

Take a remarkable Instance from Mr. <i>Dryden's Love
for Love</i>, where, from making use of a seeming Metaphor,
he is drawn into a false Thought:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Her Words were like soft Flakes of falling Snow,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Which</i> <span class="smcap">Melted</span> <i>as they fell</i>.</span>
</div></div>

<p>If her Words died away, as Snow <i>melts</i>, neutrally,
'tis no great Recommendation of them. But the Idea that
should be conveyed to the Reader is, that they <i>melted</i> the
Hearer, as they fell; and then the Comparison is spoil'd,
and may more truly be applied to the Conception of the
Poet, which melts away by the Force of Reason, as Snow
does by the Approach of the Sun.

'Tis the Business of the Poet to give <i>Life</i>,
<i>Motion</i>, or <i>Sound</i> to almost every Thing he describes,
which in Oratory would be ridiculous: Thus, for Example, put into
Prose, <i>Juvenal</i>'s<i>&mdash;&mdash;jam tum mihi barba sonabat</i>, or
<i>Virgil</i>'s Description of an Oak grafted on an Elm,&mdash;&mdash;Glandemque
<i>sues fregere sub ulmis</i>; with these lively Images
you would gain the Reader's Smile, not his Admiration.

Mr. <i>Fontenelle</i>, and Mr. <i>Pope</i>, in their
Discourses on Pastoral Poetry, are of <i>Scaliger</i>'s Opinion.
But I might observe, in Favour of Dr. <i>Trapp</i>'s,
that the most ancient <i>Greek</i> Poets, whose Names are preserv'd,
are not supposed to have been Pastoral Writers. The <i>Greeks</i>
seem to have been persuaded that their Hymns were the first Productions
in Verse:<br />

A small Mistake, which, I suppose, <i>Joannes Antonius
Viperanus</i> led our Author into, tho' <i>Vossius</i> expresly
guards against it. <i>Inter Latinos unum habemus Virgilium&mdash;&mdash;quem
liceat imitari</i>, says <i>Anton. Viperanus</i>; from
whence <i>Vossius</i> imagines he never saw those two Bucolic
Writers, (which is more than his Words necessarily imply)
and takes Care to let us know, we have four Eclogues
of <i>Nemesianus</i>, and seven of <i>Calpurnius</i>. Mr.
<i>Fontenelle</i> gives no disadvantageous Character of both of them,
and, in some Particulars, prefers <i>Calpurnius</i> to <i>Virgil</i>
himself. <i>Fabricius</i> mentions seven or eight Editions of these two
Poets, and they may be seen in the <i>Corpus Poetarum Latinorum</i>,
publish'd in our Author's Time.

Mons. <i>Dacier</i>, who borrow'd the Observation from
<i>Is. Casaubon</i>, should have mention'd some Authority for
this Expression of <i>Leges Saturæ</i>; because <i>Vossius</i>, who
allows the like Use of the Word, yet questions the Grammarians
in this Instance. <i>Festus</i> cites, <i>Imperium, quod
Plebes per saturam dederat, id abrogatum est</i>. Again,
<i>Dein postero die, quasi per saturam sententiis exquisitis, in
deditionem accipitur</i>, "ubi <i>per saturam</i> valet collectim ac
raptim. At non video, says <i>Vossius</i>, ut hinc colligi
possit, fuisse Romanis legem ullam, quæ <i>satura</i> diceretur."

<i>Casaubon</i> expresly says, that <i>Horace</i> imitated
<i>Lucilius</i>; his Point was not to prove that <i>Lucilius</i>'s Satires
were of a different Kind from <i>Horace</i>'s, but from <i>Ennius</i>'s.
Mons. <i>Dacier</i>, on the contrary, maintains, that the Satires
of <i>Horace</i>, <i>Lucilius</i>, and <i>Ennius</i>, were all of the
same Species. And yet, I think, very hardly reconciles
his Opinion with Antiquity. He produces <i>Quintilian</i>:
<i>Alterum illud &amp; prius Satiræ</i> <span class="smcap">GENUS</span>, <i>quod non solum
Carminum varietate mistum condidit Terentius Varro</i>. <i>Quintilian</i>,

<i>Vossius</i>'s Opinion seems to be the Result of his
Enquiry into the Original of Satire, which he observes to have
arose out of the old Comedy. From whence he maintains,
that the chearful bantering Humour should be still
kept up, and not be forfeited for Moroseness: And for the
same Reason, the Style should be near allied to Prose. In
both which Particulars, and indeed in all the others which
he mentions, he sets <i>Horace</i> for an Example.

And yet it seems to be an agreed Point among many
of the Learned, that the Plays of the Ancients were acted
in a Kind of Recitative set to the Flute. See this proved
by <i>Crusius</i>, in his Lives of the <i>Roman</i> Poets, in the
Introduction to Dramatic Poets, § IV. Dr. <i>Bentley</i>, in his
Preface to <i>Terence</i>, takes it for granted. See, likewise,
<i>Cic. ad. Brutum</i>, § 55. The Objections which Dr.
<i>Trapp</i> makes against it, would hold, in some Degree, against
Chanting: And perhaps both may be accounted
for, from the same prudential Reason, <i>viz.</i> That the
Voice, when continued for some Time very elevated,
naturally falls into a Tone, and yet it was necessary it
should be very elevated in the ancient Theatre, which was
very large, as well as in Cathedrals. To prevent the Disagreeableness
of this, it was regulated by a sort of Music.

The forecited Author, Mr. <i>Crusius</i>, thinks
them to have been of great Use and Expediency to the Ancients;
Their Stage being very large, and their Plays acted by
Day-light, the natural Features of the Face, at such a
Distance, and without the Help of false Lights, could
not appear distinguishable enough, to express the several
Characters. Besides the adapting Masks to each Character,
very much contributed to the Entertainment of
the Audience; since hereby they could better imagine
they saw the Persons represented in the Play, than we
can, who are still apt to lose the Character in the Player;
not to mention this other Disadvantage of the same
Face appearing in the different Characters of Prince
and Pimp, Hero and Villain, old and young." <i>Ibid.</i>
Sect. III. So that what they lost in expressing the Variety
of Passion, they gain'd in the Variety of Character.

As to the prior Antiquity of Comedy or Tragedy, History
must be our only Guide; for I think it cannot be
suppos'd that either of them existed, before Mankind knew
what State and Magnificence was. Both had their Rise
from the Songs at the Feasts of <i>Bacchus</i>. <i>Susarion</i> is said
to be the Inventor of the first, and <i>Thespis</i> of the latter.
So <i>Marm. Arundel. &amp;c.</i> And yet <i>Horace</i> says, <i>Successit
vetus his Com&oelig;dia</i>, having spoken before of Tragedy and
Satire; which is reconcil'd by supposing <i>Epicharmus</i> (who
liv'd later than <i>Thespis</i>) the <i>Inventor</i> of Comedy in
<i>Horace</i>'s Judgment, because he was the first <i>Writer</i> of
it. See <i>Bentley's Answer to Boyle</i>, p. 238, 199, 200.

Another Reason against it is, that Τρυγωδια never
signifies <i>Tragedy</i>, but <i>Comedy</i> only. <i>Casaubon</i>,
indeed, <i>de Satyr. Poesi</i>, says, it originally comprehended both.
But his Opinion depends solely on the <i>Etymolog. Mag.</i> which is
contradicted by all the other Lexicographers. The Authorities he
produces from <i>Aristotle</i> and <i>Athenæus</i>, make
nothing for his Purpose. See <i>Bentley</i> against <i>Boyle</i>,
p. 306, 307, 308. Which I mention the rather, because the ingenious
Mr. <i>Crusius</i> has not in this, and some other Instances,
profited by that learned Author's Observations.

I am at a Loss here to know what <i>Vossius</i> means, who
seems to intimate, that in the <i>Hecuba</i> of <i>Euripides</i>, the
Death of <i>Ægisthus</i> added to the Terror and Distress of the
Play. But as <i>Agamemnon</i> himself is one of the Persons in
the Drama, there could be no Thoughts of revenging a
Death, which had not happen'd. In the <i>Electra</i>,
there is an account of <i>Ægisthus</i>'s Death; but that Incident
is not of so much Consequence there, as <i>Vossius</i> seems
to make it in the Tragedy he alludes to. It is therefore
most probable, that what is here said relates to the <i>Electra</i>
of <i>Sophocles</i>; where the concluding Scene represents the
meeting of <i>Orestes</i> and <i>Ægisthus</i>, and the latter is
conducted off the Stage, only to be put to Death in the same
Place where he kill'd <i>Agamemnon</i>. A short Sentence has
probably been originally left out in <i>Vossius</i>, which would
have clear'd this Matter, in Words to this Effect; <i>Sic tristis
exitus in Sophoclis Electra, ubi Ægisthus</i>, &amp;c. It is much
our Author, who, upon many other Occasions, has censur'd
<i>Vossius</i>, should pass over a Mistake of this Nature.

<i>Vossius</i> guards against all the Inconsistence he is
here charg'd with, which is no more than this; That it is
<i>essential</i> to a Tragedy, form'd κατα την τεχνην, to end
unfortunately, but not so to one made <i>ad populum</i>. He borrow'd
his Sentiment from <i>Aristotle</i>, De Arte Poetica,
εστιν δε ουχ ἁυτη απο τραγωιδιαϛ ἡδονη, αλλα μαλλον τηϛ κωμωιδιαϛ οικεια
<i>this is not a Pleasure that arises from Tragedy, but rather of

Those Tragedies that are writ according to the <i>nicest Rules of Art</i>,
he said before, upon the Authority of <i>Aristotle</i>, do
<b>NOT</b> end happily: And upon the same Authority
he says, in <i>such</i> Plays the Characters are neither extremely
wicked, nor perfectly virtuous. <i>Aristotle</i>, as a
Heathen, was right in his Opinion, according to Dr. <i>Trapp</i>'s
Theory; <i>Vossius</i>, who follows him throughout, is not inconsistent.
As to the Opinion in general, I will not pretend
to determine, since it is <i>dignus vindice nodus</i>.

They are very easy to be found in c. XIV. of
<i>Aristotle</i>'s Art of Poetry, according to <i>Dan. Heinsius</i>'s
Edition; c. XIII. in others. All that <i>Vossius</i> has advanc'd above,
is only a Comment on that Chapter. Does <i>Vossius</i> say the
<i>best</i> Tragedies are conformable to these Rules? So does <i>Aristotle</i>,
ἡ μεν κατα την τεχνην καλλιστη τραγωδια εκ ταυτηϛ τηϛ συστασεωϛ εστι,
p. m. 270, <i>&amp;c.</i> That we are not
affected with Compassion or Terror at the Sufferings of the Wicked?
so does <i>Aristotle</i>, ουτε ελεεινο, ουτε φοβερον φαινεται το συμβαινον,
p. 269. That a middle Character is to be chosen? so does <i>Aristotle</i>,
ὁ μεταξυ αρα τουτων λοιποϛ, εσι δεγοιουτοϛ, <i>&amp;c.</i>

<i>Ratio</i> in <i>Vossius</i>, is not us'd

seems to take it, but in the same Sense with that noted
Saying, <i>ratio ultima regum</i>, the last Expedient, or Resort
of Kings. The Instances alledg'd illustrate this: <i>Medea</i>
is forc'd to kill her Brother <i>Absyrtus</i>, to secure her own
Escape; and her Children afterwards, to prevent them
from falling into such Hands as would execute greater Cruelties
upon them. The Circumstance of <i>Oedipus</i>, made
unfortunate not by real Crimes, is very well describ'd by
Mr. <i>Lee</i>:</p>

that the <i>Pleasure</i> the Mind takes is, in <i>learning</i> the
Likeness between the Representation and the Original.

The Reader will understand this Distinction much
better by the Examples which the Author has mention'd in
his Preface to the <i>Æneis</i>; and I shall, for that Reason, take
the Liberty to transcribe some of them. "The Storm, in
the first Book of <i>Virgil</i>, driving the Fleet on the Coast
of <i>Carthage</i>, is an Incident, not an Episode, because
the Hero himself, and the whole Body of his Forces,
are concern'd in it; and so it is a direct, and not a collateral
Part of the main Action. The Adventures of
<i>Nisus</i> and <i>Euryalus</i>, in the 9th Book, are Episodes, not
Incidents; <i>i.e.</i> not direct Parts of the main Action."

Thus prov'd by <i>Bossu</i>: The <i>Iliad</i> begins with
the Plague, which lasts ten Days. The Poet allows for the
Recovery of the <i>Grecians</i> 10, Battles that follow 5, Funeral
Rites of <i>Patroclus</i> 11, and of <i>Hector</i> 11; in all, 47.

The <i>Odyssey</i>, according to the same Author, Book III.
c. XII. takes up 58 Days. And the <i>Æneis</i> is reduc'd within
half a Year, or a single Campaign, beginning where Dr.
<i>Trapp</i> does. I know not how <i>Bossu</i> came to be
so misrepresented.

See p. 45. of the Author's Preface to the <i>Æneis</i>,
where the Comparison between these two Poets is drawn
out at large. As the Case is commonly stated, <i>Homer</i> excell'd
in <i>Fire</i> and <i>Invention</i>, and <i>Virgil</i> in Judgment; but
Dr. <i>Trapp</i> does not allow <i>Homer</i>'s Superiority in any
Respect. "It is a great Error (says he) to think that
all Fire consists in quarrelling and fighting, as do three
Parts in four of <i>Homer</i>'s, in his <i>Iliad</i>. The Fire we are
speaking of is Spirit and Vivacity, Energy of Thought
and Expression, which Way soever it affects; whether
it fires us by Anger, or otherwise, nay, tho' it does not
fire us at all, but even produces a quite contrary Effect.
However it may sound like a Paradox, it is the Property
of this poetical Flame, to chill us with Horror,
and make us weep with Pity, as well as kindle us with
Indignation, Love, or Glory. Not that <i>Virgil</i> is deficient
in that Sort of Fire, the fierce, the rapid, the fighting."</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Pope</i>'s Sentiments of these two Poets are somewhat
different; the Reader shall have the Pleasure of comparing
them; "This Fire (says he) is discern'd in <i>Virgil</i>,
but discern'd as thro' a Glass, reflected, and more shining
than warm, but every where equal and constant:
In <i>Lucan</i>, and <i>Statius</i>, it bursts out in sudden, short,
and interrupted Flames: In <i>Milton</i> it glows like a Furnace,
kept to an uncommon Fierceness by the Force of Art:
In <i>Shakespear</i>, it strikes before we are aware, like an
accidental Fire from Heaven: But in <i>Homer</i>, and in him
only, it burns every where clearly, and every where
irresistibly." <i>Pope</i>'s Translation of <i>Homer</i>'s <i>Iliad</i>.
Dr. <i>Trapp</i> criticizes on this Passage.
